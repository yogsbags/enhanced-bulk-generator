- **Dividend Rights**: Share in company profits (when declared)
- **Capital Appreciation**: Share price can increase over time
- **Dematerialized Form**: Held electronically via Demat account (CDSL/NSDL)
- **Indivisibility**: Cannot split into fractional units (must trade whole shares)
- **Perpetual Existence**: Shares exist as long as company operates

### H2: How Are Shares Regulated?

- **SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India)**: Primary regulator
  - Protects investor interests
  - Regulates stock exchanges, brokers, depositories
  - Enforces disclosure norms and listing requirements
  - Monitors market manipulation and insider trading
- **Stock Exchanges**: NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)
  - Listing requirements for companies
  - Trading surveillance and circuit breakers
  - Disclosure of price-sensitive information
- **Depositories**: CDSL and NSDL
  - Maintain electronic share records
  - Track ownership and transfers
- **Companies Act, 2013**: Governs share issuance, buybacks, dividends

- **Listing Agreement**: Continuous disclosure requirements for listed companies

### H2: The Role of Shares in Determining Market Capitalization

- **Market Capitalization Formula**: Market Cap = Share Price × Total Outstanding Shares
- **Classification by Market Cap**:
  - **Large Cap**: Market cap > ₹20,000 crore (Nifty 50 companies)
  - **Mid Cap**: Market cap ₹5,000 - ₹20,000 crore
  - **Small Cap**: Market cap < ₹5,000 crore
- **Indian Example**:
  - Reliance Industries: 6.7 billion shares × ₹2,500 = ₹16.75 lakh crore market cap
  - TCS: 3.6 billion shares × ₹3,800 = ₹13.68 lakh crore market cap
- **Impact on Indices**: Nifty 50 and Sensex are market-cap weighted
- **Stock Splits**: Increases share count, reduces price per share (market cap unchanged)
- **Bonus Issues**: Increases shares, dilutes price (market cap unchanged)
- **Buybacks**: Reduces outstanding shares, increases price per share

### H2: Authorized, Issued, and Outstanding Shares – Key Differences

**Create a comparison table:**

| Parameter | Authorized Shares | Issued Shares | Outstanding Shares |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Definition | Maximum shares company can legally issue | Total shares company has issued to date | Shares currently held by investors |
| Set By | Memorandum of Association (MOA) | Board/shareholder approval | Market transactions |
| Can Change? | Yes (requires shareholder approval) | Yes (within authorized limit) | Yes (buybacks, new issuances) |
| Example (TCS) | 10 billion shares (authorized) | 7.2 billion shares (issued) | 3.6 billion shares (outstanding) |
| Difference | Total capacity | Actually issued | Publicly held |
| Treasury Stock | Not applicable | Issued but not outstanding | Not included |
| Indian Example | Company MOA states 100 crore authorized | Company issues 60 crore shares | 50 crore in market + 10 crore treasury |

### H2: Can You Buy One Share of Stock?

| Specificity | Specific to one company | Generic term for multiple shares |
| Nominal Value | Has face value (₹1, ₹2, ₹10) | No specific face value |
| Usage (Singular) | "I own 100 shares of Reliance" | "I invest in stock market" |
