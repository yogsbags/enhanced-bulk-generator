| SIP Facility | Not offered by most brokers | Widely available |

### H2: What are Exchange Traded Funds?

- Definition: Mutual funds that trade like stocks on exchanges
- Passively managed to track an index (Nifty 50, Sensex, etc.)
- Creation and redemption through Authorized Participants (APs)
- Examples in India:
  - Nippon India ETF Nifty BeES
  - SBI ETF Nifty 50
  - HDFC Nifty 50 ETF
- How ETFs work:
  - Listed on NSE/BSE
  - Buy/sell anytime during market hours
  - Price fluctuates throughout the day
  - May trade at premium/discount to NAV

### H2: What are Index Funds?

- Definition: Mutual funds that replicate an index
- Passive fund management (no stock picking)
- Priced once daily at Net Asset Value (NAV)
- Examples in India:
  - UTI Nifty Index Fund
  - ICICI Prudential Nifty Index Fund
  - HDFC Index Fund - Nifty 50 Plan
- How Index Funds work:
  - Purchase directly from AMC or through platforms
  - Units allotted at day-end NAV
  - No intraday price movement
  - Always transact at exact NAV (no premium/discount)

### H2: Benefits of Passive Funds – ETFs and Index Funds

**Give pointers and make them H3:**

#### H3: Low Cost of Investment
- Minimal expense ratios (0.05% - 0.50%) vs active funds (1% - 2.5%)
- No stock research or fund manager fees
- Long-term compounding benefit from lower costs
- Example: ₹10 lakh invested over 20 years saves ₹5+ lakh in fees

#### H3: Diversification

- Nifty 50 ETF/Index Fund = instant diversification across sectors
- Reduces company-specific risk
- Market-cap weighted allocation

#### H3: Transparency
- Holdings mirror the index exactly
- Daily disclosure of portfolio
- No hidden stock picks or style drift
- Easy to understand and track

#### H3: Tax Efficiency
- Lower portfolio turnover = fewer capital gains events
- Long-term holding (>12 months): 12.5% LTCG tax (above ₹1.25L exemption)
- Short-term (<12 months): 20% STCG tax
- Same tax treatment as equity mutual funds

#### H3: Consistent Performance
- Matches index performance (minus small tracking error)
- No risk of underperforming the index
- 80% of active funds fail to beat Nifty 50 over 10 years

### H2: Where Should You Invest – ETFs versus Index Funds?

**Choose ETFs if:**
- You have lump sum amount to invest
- You prefer intraday trading flexibility
- You want the lowest possible expense ratio
- You already have a Demat account
- You're comfortable with bid-ask spreads

**Choose Index Funds if:**
- You want to start a monthly SIP
- You prefer simplicity (no Demat account needed)
- You're a long-term buy-and-hold investor
- You want to avoid tracking error from spreads
- You prefer buying directly from AMC

**For most Indian retail investors:**

- ETFs are better for lump sum deployment
- Consider both: SIP in Index Fund + lump sum in ETF

### H2: Conclusion

- Decision depends on investment style, not product superiority

- Lump sum investors: ETFs win due to lower costs

### H2: FAQs on ETF vs Index Fund

#### H3: Which is Better, ETF or Index Fund?
- Neither is universally "better" - depends on your investing style
- **Index Funds better for**: Monthly SIP, beginners, no Demat account
- **ETFs better for**: Lump sum, lower expense ratios, active traders
- **Bottom line**: Both are excellent; choose based on convenience

#### H3: Can I Do SIP with ETF?
- Traditional SIP not widely available for ETFs in India
- Some brokers offer "Automated ETF purchase" but not true SIP
- Workaround: Manually buy ETF units every month
- **Better option**: Use Index Funds for systematic monthly investing
- Exception: Some platforms now offering ETF SIPs (check with broker)

#### H3: Is the S&P 500 ETF an Index Fund?
- S&P 500 ETF **is** an index fund that trades on exchange
- Confusion: "Index Fund" often refers to non-traded mutual funds
- Technically: All ETFs tracking indexes are "index funds"
- Practically: "Index Fund" = mutual fund, "ETF" = exchange-traded
- In India: Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund available (not ETF yet)

#### H3: What is the 3:5:10 Rule for ETF?
- Not a standard ETF rule in Indian investing
- Possibly refers to: 3% expense cap, 5% tracking error limit, 10% allocation
- **Actual good rule**: Keep equity ETF/Index fund allocation at 60-80% of portfolio
- Diversify across large-cap, mid-cap, and debt for balance
- Consult financial advisor for personalized allocation
