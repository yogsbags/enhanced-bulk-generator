<h2>Executive Summary</h2><div class="executive-summary">
<p>Protective put is a portfolio insurance strategy that protects your stock or index holdings against downside risk. You buy put options while holding the underlying asset, creating a safety net with limited maximum loss and unlimited upside potential.</p>
<p>This guide covers complete implementation, cost analysis, portfolio protection mechanics, and real Nifty examples. The focus is practical knowledge for capital preservation during market volatility.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy type: Portfolio insurance, downside protection</li>
<li>Capital required: 1-3% of portfolio value for put premium</li>
<li>Maximum loss: Limited to strike price minus spot price plus premium paid</li>
<li>Maximum profit: Unlimited upside minus put premium cost</li>
<li>Ideal market: Uncertain conditions, high volatility expected</li>
<li>Nifty lot size: 75 units (subject to NSE revisions)*</li>
<li>Best used in: Bull markets with protection or before uncertain events</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Protective put combines long stock/index position with long put options. This creates a floor below which losses cannot exceed. Think of it as insurance for your portfolio - you pay premium upfront for downside protection while keeping full upside participation.</p>
<p>Most investors hold stocks or Nifty positions without protection. When markets crash 5-10%, portfolios suffer severe losses. Protective put eliminates this catastrophic risk. The tradeoff is the premium cost which reduces overall returns in stable or rising markets.</p>
<p>Professional portfolio managers use this during uncertain periods. Market at all-time highs but worried about correction? Elections, budget announcements, or global uncertainty ahead? Protective put lets you stay invested while capping maximum loss.</p>
<hr>
</div><h2>Understanding Protective Put Mechanics</h2>
<h3>What is Protective Put</h3>
<p>Protective put combines two positions: long underlying asset and long put option. Creates synthetic long call position with defined risk.</p>
<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Nifty position (buy Nifty ETF, futures, or stocks mirroring index)</li>
<li>Buy 1 ATM or slightly OTM put option</li>
<li>Both positions in same quantity</li>
<li>Put expiry based on protection timeframe needed</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates position with limited downside and unlimited upside. Maximum loss equals current price minus strike price plus premium paid. Maximum gain is theoretically unlimited minus premium.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>
<p>Protective put is a hedging strategy. It&#39;s also called portfolio insurance or married put when shares and puts are purchased simultaneously. The put &quot;protects&quot; or &quot;insures&quot; your long position.</p>
<p>Strategy is neither bullish nor bearish inherently. It&#39;s bullish with protection. You expect markets to rise but want insurance against unexpected downside.</p>
<h3>How Protective Put Works</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Market Rises Above Strike</strong></p>
<p>You hold Nifty at 24,000, bought 23,900 put for ₹120 premium. Nifty rises to 24,500.</p>
<p>Your Nifty position gains: 500 points × 75 = ₹37,500.
Put expires worthless. You lose premium: ₹120 × 75 = ₹9,000.
Net profit: ₹37,500 - ₹9,000 = ₹28,500.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Market Falls Below Strike</strong></p>
<p>Nifty crashes to 23,200 (800 points below strike).</p>
<p>Your Nifty position loses: 800 points × 75 = ₹60,000.
Put option gains: (23,900 - 23,200) = 700 points × 75 = ₹52,500.
Premium paid: ₹120 × 75 = ₹9,000.
Net loss: ₹60,000 - ₹52,500 - ₹9,000 = ₹16,500 (limited).</p>
<p>Without put protection, loss would be ₹60,000. Put limited loss to ₹16,500.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Market Stays Near Strike</strong></p>
<p>Nifty expires at 23,850 (50 points below strike).</p>
<p>Your Nifty position loses: 150 points × 75 = ₹11,250.
Put option gains: 50 points × 75 = ₹3,750.
Premium paid: ₹9,000.
Net loss: ₹11,250 - ₹3,750 + ₹9,000 = ₹16,500.</p>
<h3>Insurance Cost Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Example Comparison:</strong></p>
<p>Current Nifty: 24,000
Portfolio value: ₹18,00,000 (75 Nifty units)
Protection needed: 3 months</p>
<p><strong>Option A: No Protection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost: ₹0</li>
<li>Downside: Unlimited (could lose 10-20% in crash)</li>
<li>Upside: Full participation in gains</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: Protective Put (Buy 23,800 put)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put premium: ₹180 per contract</li>
<li>Total cost: ₹180 × 75 = ₹13,500</li>
<li>Insurance cost: 0.75% of portfolio value</li>
<li>Downside: Limited to 200 points below entry + ₹13,500 premium</li>
<li>Maximum loss: ₹15,000 + ₹13,500 = ₹28,500 (1.58% of portfolio)</li>
<li>Upside: Unlimited minus ₹13,500 premium</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, you pay 0.75% of portfolio value for protection. Maximum loss capped at 1.58% regardless of market crash severity.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Portfolio Analysis</h3>
<p>Assess your current holdings and protection needs.</p>
<p><strong>Position Check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty exposure through ETFs, futures, or basket of stocks</li>
<li>Current profit/loss on positions</li>
<li>Time horizon for holding</li>
<li>Risk tolerance for drawdown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protection Requirement:</strong></p>
<p>Calculate maximum acceptable loss. If portfolio is ₹18 lakhs and maximum acceptable loss is ₹30,000 (1.67%), select put strike accordingly.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Strike Selection</h3>
<p><strong>ATM Put (At-The-Money):</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty is 24,000, buy 24,000 put. Provides maximum protection from current level. Most expensive option but complete coverage.</p>
<p><strong>OTM Put (Out-of-The-Money):</strong></p>
<p>Buy 23,800 or 23,900 put. Cheaper premium but you absorb first 100-200 points of loss. Like insurance with deductible.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Selection Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ATM for complete protection (pay higher premium)</li>
<li>1-2% OTM for cost savings (accept small loss buffer)</li>
<li>Never go more than 3% OTM (defeats protection purpose)</li>
<li>Check put has adequate open interest (1 lakh+ contracts)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Expiry Selection</h3>
<p>Choose expiry matching your protection timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Expiry (Every Tuesday)*:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term protection (7-10 days)</li>
<li>Lower premium cost</li>
<li>Suitable for event-specific hedging</li>
<li>Requires frequent rolling if protection needed longer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly Expiry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medium-term protection (30-45 days)</li>
<li>Higher premium but more time coverage</li>
<li>Suitable for general market uncertainty</li>
<li>Roll forward as expiry approaches</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quarterly Expiry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term portfolio insurance</li>
<li>Highest premium cost</li>
<li>Suitable for multi-month holdings</li>
<li>Minimal management needed</li>
</ul>
<p>For ongoing protection, plan to roll puts before expiry. Exit old put 5-7 days before expiry and buy next month&#39;s put.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Execute the Protection</h3>
<p>Purchase put options matching your Nifty position size.</p>
<p><strong>Execution Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate exact Nifty exposure (number of units)</li>
<li>Buy equivalent puts (1 put per 75 Nifty units held)</li>
<li>Use limit orders for better fills</li>
<li>Verify position reflects properly (long Nifty + long put)</li>
<li>Set calendar reminder for expiry management</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Position Sizing:</strong></p>
<p>If holding ₹36,00,000 Nifty exposure (150 units):</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 2 put contracts (each covers 75 units)</li>
<li>Total premium: 2 × (₹180 × 75) = ₹27,000</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Ongoing Management</h3>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Monitor Protection Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Check daily that put strike still provides adequate floor. If Nifty rallied significantly, your OTM put may now be too far OTM. Consider rolling to higher strike.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Roll Before Expiry</strong></p>
<p>5-7 days before expiry, close current put and buy next month&#39;s put. This maintains continuous protection without gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Adjust on Market Changes</strong></p>
<p>If market falls close to your strike, put becomes valuable. Decide whether to hold for further protection or book put profits and exit underlying position.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Cost Management</strong></p>
<p>Track total premium spent quarterly. If premiums exceed 2-3% of portfolio annually, protection may be too expensive. Consider wider strikes or selective hedging.</p>

<h2>Risk and Reward Analysis</h2>
<h3>Maximum Profit Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Unlimited Upside - Premium Paid</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty entry: 24,000</li>
<li>Put strike: 23,900</li>
<li>Put premium: ₹150 per contract</li>
<li>For 1 lot (75 units): ₹150 × 75 = ₹11,250</li>
</ul>
<p>If Nifty rises to 25,000:
Nifty gain: 1,000 × 75 = ₹75,000
Premium cost: ₹11,250
Net profit: ₹75,000 - ₹11,250 = ₹63,750</p>
<p><strong>Example Return:</strong> ₹63,750 profit on ₹18,00,000 position = 3.54% (versus 4.17% without protection)</p>
<h3>Maximum Loss Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Entry Price - Put Strike) + Premium Paid</p>
<p>Maximum loss = (24,000 - 23,900) + 150 = 250 points per contract
For 1 lot: 250 × 75 = ₹18,750</p>
<p>This occurs when market falls below put strike. Put locks in selling price at 23,900. You lose 100 points from entry to strike plus ₹11,250 premium.</p>
<p>Without protection, if Nifty crashed to 22,000, loss would be 2,000 × 75 = ₹1,50,000. Put limits loss to ₹18,750 maximum.</p>
<h3>Breakeven Point</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Entry Price + Premium Paid</p>
<p>Breakeven = 24,000 + 150 = 24,150</p>
<p>Nifty needs to rise 150 points to cover premium cost. Above 24,150, you make profit (minus premium). Below, you incur loss (but capped by put).</p>
<h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Protection Cost:</strong> ₹11,250
<strong>Portfolio Value:</strong> ₹18,00,000
<strong>Insurance Cost:</strong> 0.625% for monthly protection</p>
<p><strong>Annualized Cost:</strong> If rolling monthly, approximately 7.5% annually. This is significant drag on returns.</p>
<p><strong>When It&#39;s Worth It:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During high uncertainty (elections, policy changes, global turmoil)</li>
<li>At market tops when correction likely</li>
<li>For concentrated positions that can&#39;t be easily exited</li>
<li>When profits are substantial and need preservation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When It&#39;s Not Worth It:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In stable bull markets with low volatility</li>
<li>For long-term buy-and-hold investors</li>
<li>When portfolio can tolerate normal market fluctuations</li>
<li>If premium costs exceed potential losses</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>When to Use Protective Put</h2>
<h3>Ideal Market Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>High Valuations:</strong></p>
<p>Market at all-time highs, valuations stretched. Nifty PE ratio above 22-24. Downside risk increasing but don&#39;t want to exit positions. Perfect time for protection.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertain Events Ahead:</strong></p>
<p>RBI policy meetings, budget announcements, election results pending. Global uncertainty like Fed decisions, geopolitical tensions. Buy puts before events, let them expire worthless if markets rally.</p>
<p><strong>Volatile Markets:</strong></p>
<p>India VIX above 18-20, indicating heightened fear. Premiums are expensive but protection is most valuable. Markets swinging 1-2% daily. Protective puts provide peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Profit Protection:</strong></p>
<p>Portfolio up 30-40% for the year. Want to lock in gains without selling (tax implications). Buy puts to protect profits while staying invested.</p>
<h3>Avoid This Strategy When</h3>
<p><strong>Stable Bull Markets:</strong></p>
<p>Clear uptrend, low volatility (VIX 10-14). Premium costs eat into returns unnecessarily. Better to stay unhedged and enjoy full upside.</p>
<p><strong>Already Oversold Conditions:</strong></p>
<p>Market corrected 10-15%, sitting at strong support. Downside limited from current levels. Buying puts here is expensive protection for small further downside.</p>
<p><strong>Short-Term Trading:</strong></p>
<p>If your holding period is 2-3 days, protective puts make no sense. Position management and stops are better tools than options insurance.</p>
<h3>Best Entry Timing</h3>
<p><strong>Before Major Events:</strong></p>
<p>Week before RBI policy, budget, or elections. Put premiums may be lower than immediate pre-event spike. Gives protection through uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>After Strong Rally:</strong></p>
<p>Market rallied 5-7% in 2-3 weeks without correction. Momentum strong but pullback likely. Enter protective puts to guard against sudden reversal.</p>
<p><strong>Volatility Dips:</strong></p>
<p>VIX drops to 12-14 (low levels). Put premiums are cheap. Good time to buy insurance even if markets seem stable.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio Rebalancing:</strong></p>
<p>Just added significant capital to portfolio. Exposure increased substantially. Add puts to protect new capital during adjustment period.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Understanding Risk Factors</h2>
<h3>Price Movement (Delta)</h3>
<p>Protective put has delta near +0.5 overall. Your Nifty position has delta +1.0, put has delta approximately -0.5. Net position behaves like holding 50% of Nifty with 50% cash.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty rises 100 points, you gain approximately 50 points net effect (full Nifty gain minus put value loss). If Nifty falls 100 points, you lose approximately 50 points (Nifty loss partially offset by put gain).</p>
<p>As market approaches put strike, protection becomes more effective. Put delta moves toward -1.0, fully offsetting Nifty losses below strike.</p>
<h3>Time Decay (Theta)</h3>
<p>Time works against put buyers. Protective put loses value daily from theta decay.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put premium: ₹150</li>
<li>30 days to expiry</li>
<li>Daily theta decay: ₹5-8 per day initially</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day, you pay invisible insurance premium through theta. This cost is predictable and manageable if markets remain stable or rise.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Period:</strong> Last 10 days before expiry, theta accelerates dramatically. Plan to roll puts 5-7 days before expiry to avoid maximum decay phase.</p>
<h3>Volatility Impact (Vega)</h3>
<p>Volatility increases benefit put buyers. If VIX spikes, put values rise significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<p>During market stress, VIX jumps from 14 to 25. Your protective put gains value from both market decline AND volatility increase. This dual benefit makes puts most valuable exactly when you need them.</p>
<p>Enter protective puts when volatility is low to moderate (VIX 12-16). Avoid buying when VIX already spiked above 22 (premiums too expensive).</p>

<h2>Real Nifty Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Successful Protection During Crash</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: October 15, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty entry: 24,350 (long position)</li>
<li>Position size: 150 units (₹36,52,500)</li>
<li>View: Concerned about upcoming RBI policy</li>
<li>India VIX: 15.2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protection Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,200 put (slightly OTM) at ₹165 × 75 × 2 lots</li>
<li>Total premium: ₹24,750</li>
<li>Expiry: November 19, 2025 (monthly)</li>
<li>Maximum loss: (150 points to strike + 165 premium) = 315 points × 150 units = ₹47,250</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Event Impact:</strong></p>
<p>October 22: RBI announces surprise hawkish stance. Market crashes.
October 23: Nifty falls to 23,100 (1,250 points drop).</p>
<p><strong>Result on October 23:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty position loss: 1,250 × 150 = ₹1,87,500</li>
<li>Put value: (24,200 - 23,100) = 1,100 points</li>
<li>Put profit: 1,100 × 150 = ₹1,65,000</li>
<li>Premium paid: ₹24,750</li>
<li>Net loss: ₹1,87,500 - ₹1,65,000 + ₹24,750 = ₹47,250</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Outcome:</strong></p>
<p>Without protection, loss would be ₹1,87,500 (5.13% of portfolio). Protective put limited loss to ₹47,250 (1.29% of portfolio). Protection cost: ₹24,750 (0.68%) for insurance that saved ₹1,40,250.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Closed both positions on October 24. Avoided further exposure. Re-entered market after stabilization at lower levels.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Premium Cost in Bull Market</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 1, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty entry: 24,150</li>
<li>Position size: 75 units (₹18,11,250)</li>
<li>View: Bullish but want protection during budget season</li>
<li>India VIX: 13.8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protection Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,000 put at ₹140 × 75</li>
<li>Total premium: ₹10,500</li>
<li>Expiry: November 26, 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market Movement:</strong></p>
<p>Market continues rally. Nifty steadily rises to 24,800 by November 20.</p>
<p><strong>Result on November 20:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty position gain: 650 × 75 = ₹48,750</li>
<li>Put expires worthless: Loss of ₹10,500 premium</li>
<li>Net profit: ₹48,750 - ₹10,500 = ₹38,250</li>
<li>Return: 2.11% (versus 2.69% without protection)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Protection cost 0.58% in premium. Market rallied, insurance not needed. This is normal and acceptable. Insurance that isn&#39;t used is still valuable for peace of mind and risk management.</p>
<p>Over 10 trades, if protection saves you once from major loss, the strategy pays for itself. Think of it like car insurance - you hope to not use it but glad it&#39;s there.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Buying Too Far OTM</strong></p>
<p>Selecting put 5-7% below current price saves premium but provides little protection. First 5% loss is unprotected defeating the purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Wrong Position Sizing</strong></p>
<p>Buying 1 put for 150 Nifty units held. Only 50% protected. Always match put quantity to underlying exposure exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Forgetting to Roll</strong></p>
<p>Put expires, you forget to buy new one. Gap in protection. Set calendar reminders 7 days before each expiry.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Buying When VIX is High</strong></p>
<p>Purchasing protection when VIX is 25+. Premiums extremely expensive. Better to buy when VIX below 18.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: No Exit Plan</strong></p>
<p>Market falls to strike, put is valuable. Holding both positions hoping for recovery. Should exit or adjust when protection triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 6: Over-Protecting Small Positions</strong></p>
<p>Buying protection for ₹5 lakh position. Premium cost (1%) = ₹5,000. For small positions, use stop losses instead.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 7: Annual Insurance Mentality</strong></p>
<p>Keeping continuous protection all year. Annual cost 8-10% of portfolio. Excessive. Use selectively during uncertain periods only.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Protective put provides defined risk portfolio insurance while maintaining unlimited upside participation minus premium cost.</p>
<p>Strategy costs typically 0.5-1% monthly premium for ATM protection. This compounds to 6-12% annually if held continuously throughout year.</p>
<p>Most effective during uncertain periods, market tops, or before major events. Avoid in stable bull markets where cost outweighs benefit significantly.</p>
<p>Strike selection balances cost and protection level. ATM puts provide complete coverage at highest cost. 2% OTM offers 80% protection at 40% lower premium.</p>
<p>Rolling strategy maintains continuous protection. Exit puts 5-7 days before expiry and buy next month to avoid theta acceleration and gaps.</p>
<p>Think insurance not investment. Most protection expires worthless, this is ideal outcome. Cost is peace of mind and capital preservation during crashes.</p>
<p>Position sizing must match exactly. 1 put per 75 Nifty units held. Under-hedging defeats purpose, over-hedging wastes premium unnecessarily.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1-2: Assessment Phase</strong></p>
<p>Calculate your total Nifty exposure across all holdings. Determine maximum acceptable loss percentage (typically 2-5%). Review historical VIX levels and premium costs. Study past events when protection would have saved money.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3-4: Paper Trading</strong></p>
<p>Track protective put costs for your portfolio size. Monitor premium variations with volatility changes. Practice rolling mechanics without real money. Calculate annualized protection cost at different frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>Month 2: Selective Protection</strong></p>
<p>Start with event-specific hedging only. Budget announcement, RBI policy, or major global event ahead. Buy protection 7-10 days before event. Let it expire post-event.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3: Portfolio Context</strong></p>
<p>Track correlation between portfolio drawdowns and VIX spikes. Identify your personal fear threshold for losses. Develop rules for when protection is warranted versus when to stay unhedged.</p>
<p><strong>Month 4: Optimization</strong></p>
<p>Test different strike selections (ATM versus 2% OTM). Measure total premium spent versus maximum loss avoided. Refine your protection triggers based on market conditions and portfolio size.</p>
<p>Review quarterly: Insurance spending should not exceed 2-3% of portfolio annually. If protection costs more than average quarterly market volatility, strategy needs adjustment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Protective put strategy delivers peace of mind and capital preservation during market turmoil. The defined cost structure makes it superior to panic selling or hoping losses reverse.</p>
<p>Strategy works best selectively deployed during uncertain periods rather than continuous year-round protection. Insurance costs can exceed benefits if over-used in stable markets.</p>
<p>Success requires discipline in cost management, timely rolling, and realistic expectations. Protection that expires worthless is not failure - it&#39;s insurance that wasn&#39;t needed and that&#39;s the best outcome.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q1: What is protective put strategy in Nifty options?</strong></p>
<p>Protective put combines long Nifty position with long put option. You hold Nifty (through futures, ETF, or stocks) and buy put options matching the quantity. This creates insurance against downside while maintaining upside participation. Maximum loss is limited to strike difference plus premium. Used for portfolio protection during uncertain times.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: How much does protective put cost for Nifty portfolio?</strong></p>
<p>Typically 0.5-1% of portfolio value monthly for ATM protection. For ₹18 lakh Nifty position, monthly ATM put costs ₹9,000-₹18,000. OTM puts (2-3% below) cost 30-40% less. Annual continuous protection runs 6-12% of portfolio value. Most investors use selectively, not continuously, to reduce costs.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: When should I use protective put for my Nifty holdings?</strong></p>
<p>Use before major uncertain events (RBI policy, budget, elections). When market at all-time highs but you don&#39;t want to exit. During periods of rising volatility (VIX 15-20). To protect substantial unrealized profits. Avoid in stable bull markets or when VIX already very high (premiums too expensive).</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Should I buy ATM or OTM puts for Nifty portfolio protection?</strong></p>
<p>ATM puts provide complete protection from current level but cost most. 1-2% OTM puts offer 80% protection at 40% lower cost - good balance. Never go beyond 3% OTM as first losses become too large. Choose based on risk tolerance and budget constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: How do I manage protective puts before expiry?</strong></p>
<p>Exit current put 5-7 days before expiry and buy next month&#39;s put simultaneously (called rolling). This maintains continuous protection without gaps. If market fell close to strike, decide whether to hold protection or exit both positions. Set calendar reminders for each expiry date to avoid lapses.</p>

        "text": "Typically 0.5-1% of portfolio value monthly for ATM protection. For ₹18 lakh Nifty position, monthly ATM put costs ₹9,000-₹18,000. OTM puts (2-3% below) cost 30-40% less. Annual continuous protection runs 6-12% of portfolio value. Most investors use selectively, not continuously, to reduce costs."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use before major uncertain events (RBI policy, budget, elections). When market at all-time highs but you don't want to exit. During periods of rising volatility (VIX 15-20). To protect substantial unrealized profits. Avoid in stable bull markets or when VIX already very high (premiums too expensive)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ATM puts provide complete protection from current level but cost most. 1-2% OTM puts offer 80% protection at 40% lower cost - good balance. Never go beyond 3% OTM as first losses become too large. Choose based on risk tolerance and budget constraints."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Exit current put 5-7 days before expiry and buy next month's put simultaneously (called rolling). This maintains continuous protection without gaps. If market fell close to strike, decide whether to hold protection or exit both positions. Set calendar reminders for each expiry date to avoid lapses."
