<p>Bank Nifty monthly expiry creates unique trading opportunities. The dynamics differ completely from regular trading days.</p>
<p>Theta decay accelerates dramatically final hours. Options lose 70-80% value between 12 PM and 3:30 PM. This benefits sellers but destroys buyers.</p>
<p>Volatility spikes unpredictably. Bank Nifty can move 500-800 points in last hour. Small accounts get wiped out regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Why Monthly Expiry is Special:</strong></p>
<p>Bank Nifty expires on the last Tuesday of every month. This monthly cycle creates concentrated trading activity and higher volumes compared to regular days.</p>
<p>Market makers defend high OI strikes aggressively. Price often gets &quot;pinned&quot; near these levels. Understanding this saves money.</p>
<p>Most retail traders lose on expiry day. They fight extreme theta and gamma. Professionals profit from retail mistakes systematically.</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Trade Expiry Day:</strong></p>
<p>Experienced traders with 6+ months options experience. You need quick decision-making skills. Emotional control is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>Traders with sufficient capital (₹50,000+). Small accounts can&#39;t handle volatility swings. One bad trade shouldn&#39;t destroy your account.</p>
<p>Those who can watch markets continuously. Expiry day demands active monitoring. Set-and-forget doesn&#39;t work here.</p>
<hr>
</div><h2>Understanding Bank Nifty Expiry Day</h2>
<h3>What Makes Expiry Day Different</h3>
<p>Regular days see gradual theta decay. Expiry day theta accelerates exponentially. Options lose value even without price movement.</p>
<p>Gamma risk peaks at ATM strikes. Small Bank Nifty moves create huge P&amp;L swings. Your option can double or halve in minutes.</p>
<p>Bid-ask spreads widen significantly. Liquidity disappears for OTM options post 2 PM. Execution becomes difficult and costly.</p>
<h3>Expiry Day vs Other Days</h3>
<p><strong>Regular Trading Days:</strong> Predictable decay. Theta loss is 15-20% typically. Manageable for option buyers.</p>
<p><strong>Expiry Morning (9:15-11:00 AM):</strong> Moderate acceleration. Theta loss increases to 30-40%. Still tradeable for directional plays.</p>
<p><strong>Expiry Afternoon (12:00-3:30 PM):</strong> Extreme acceleration. Theta loss reaches 70-80%. Only sellers and scalpers profit.</p>
<h3>Time Decay Timeline on Expiry Day</h3>
<p><strong>9:15-10:00 AM:</strong> Options retain 60-70% value. Still time for moves to materialize.</p>
<p><strong>10:00-12:00 PM:</strong> Decay accelerates to 40-50% loss. Decision time for buyers.</p>
<p><strong>12:00-2:00 PM:</strong> Extreme decay begins. 60-70% value destroyed. Exit long options.</p>
<p><strong>2:00-3:30 PM:</strong> Final hour destruction. 80-90% decay. Only market makers profit.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How Expiry Day Behaves</h2>
<h3>Volatility Patterns</h3>
<p>Morning session (9:15-10:30 AM) shows highest volatility. Opening positions get squared off. Gap openings are common.</p>
<p>Mid-day consolidation (11:00 AM-1:00 PM) provides brief calm. Bank Nifty ranges 200-300 points. Best for range-bound strategies.</p>
<p>Final hour chaos (2:30-3:30 PM) brings maximum volatility. 500-1000 point moves happen. Institutional players drive the action.</p>
<h3>Pin Risk Near High OI Strikes</h3>
<p>Bank Nifty gravitates toward high OI strikes. Market makers have vested interest defending these levels.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Maximum call OI at 49,500. Maximum put OI at 49,000.</p>
<p>Bank Nifty likely settles between 49,000-49,500. Price gets &quot;pinned&quot; to max pain zone.</p>
<p>Breaking these levels requires massive buying/selling pressure. Usually doesn&#39;t happen without major news.</p>
<h3>Premium Decay Acceleration</h3>
<p>ATM option at 9:15 AM: ₹300 premium. Same option at 12:00 PM: ₹120 premium (60% decay).</p>
<p>Same option at 2:00 PM: ₹50 premium (83% decay). At 3:20 PM: ₹5-10 premium (97% decay).</p>
<p>This decay happens even if Bank Nifty price stays constant. Time alone destroys value.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Best Strategies for Expiry Day</h2>
<h3>Strategy 1: OTM Option Buying (Directional)</h3>
<p>Use when expecting strong directional move morning itself. Must have conviction based on gap opening or news.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong gap opening (200+ points)</li>
<li>Volume confirmation</li>
<li>Clear directional bias from global markets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Wait for first 15 minutes. Let initial volatility settle. Identify clear direction post 9:30 AM.</p>
<p>Buy 200-300 points OTM option. Premium should be ₹30-60 maximum. Higher premiums are too risky.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Bank Nifty opens at 49,200 with 250-point gap up on expiry day. Clear bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Buy 49,400 CE at ₹45 at 9:35 AM. Investment = ₹45 × 30 = ₹1,350 per lot.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> 100-150% gain. If option reaches ₹90-110, exit immediately. Don&#39;t be greedy on expiry day.</p>
<p><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> 50% loss. If option drops to ₹22, exit. Time decay accelerates quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Time Exit:</strong> Exit by 11:30 AM regardless. Don&#39;t hold OTM options past noon on expiry day.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward:</strong> Maximum risk ₹1,350. Maximum reward ₹2,000-3,000. Win rate: 40-45%.</p>
<h3>Strategy 2: ATM Credit Spread (Theta Decay)</h3>
<p>Profit from time decay while limiting risk. Sell ATM options and buy protection further out.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Nifty in 300-point range for first hour</li>
<li>No major news expected afternoon</li>
<li>VIX stable (not spiking)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Enter between 10:30-11:30 AM. Morning volatility should settle. Range established clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Bear Call Spread Example:</strong> Bank Nifty at 49,300 at 11 AM.</p>
<p>Sell 49,400 CE at ₹100. Buy 49,500 CE at ₹60. Net credit: ₹40 × 30 = ₹1,200.</p>
<p>Maximum profit: ₹1,200 if Bank Nifty below 49,400 at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Maximum loss: (100 - 40) × 30 = ₹1,800 if above 49,500.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> 60-70% of maximum profit. If spread value drops to ₹15, book ₹750 profit.</p>
<p><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> If Bank Nifty crosses 49,450 with momentum, exit immediately. Don&#39;t wait for max loss.</p>
<p><strong>Time Exit:</strong> Hold till 3:00 PM if still profitable. Theta working in your favor.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward:</strong> Maximum risk ₹1,800. Maximum reward ₹1,200. Win rate: 65-70%.</p>
<h3>Strategy 3: Scalping ATM Options</h3>
<p>Quick in-and-out trades capturing 10-20 point moves. Requires constant attention and fast execution.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Active Bank Nifty movement (not dead range)</li>
<li>Tight bid-ask spreads</li>
<li>Good platform speed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Trade only between 9:45 AM-1:30 PM. Liquidity sufficient during this window.</p>
<p>Buy ATM option when Bank Nifty shows momentum. Hold for 20-50 point move maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Bank Nifty at 49,250 at 10:15 AM. Shows bullish momentum breaking 49,200.</p>
<p>Buy 49,200 CE at ₹135. Wait for Bank Nifty to hit 49,280-49,300.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> ₹20-30 premium gain. If option reaches ₹160-165, exit immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> ₹15-20 loss. Very tight stops needed. Exit if option drops to ₹115-120.</p>
<p><strong>Time Exit:</strong> Maximum hold 20-30 minutes. This is scalping, not position trading.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward:</strong> Risk ₹450-600 per lot. Reward ₹600-900 per lot. Win rate: 55-60%.</p>
<h3>Strategy 4: Iron Butterfly (Range Betting)</h3>
<p>Profit from Bank Nifty staying in tight range. Collect premium from both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Nifty consolidating 1+ hour</li>
<li>Low volatility environment</li>
<li>High confidence in range</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Enter around 11:00-11:30 AM. Let morning action settle. Establish ATM level clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Butterfly Setup:</strong> Bank Nifty at 49,300 at 11:15 AM.</p>
<p>Sell 49,300 CE at ₹115. Sell 49,300 PE at ₹110. Buy 49,500 CE at ₹55. Buy 49,100 PE at ₹50.</p>
<p>Net credit: (115 + 110 - 55 - 50) × 30 = ₹3,600.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> 50-60% of maximum profit. If combined spread drops to ₹70-80, book profit.</p>
<p><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> Exit if Bank Nifty moves 150+ points either direction. One side will hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> If threatened one side, close that side. Keep profitable side running.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward:</strong> Maximum risk ₹2,400. Maximum reward ₹3,600. Win rate: 60-65%.</p>
<h3>Strategy 5: Final Hour Momentum Trading</h3>
<p>Capture institutional last-hour moves. Highest risk but highest reward potential.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with expiry day dynamics</li>
<li>Sufficient capital to handle swings</li>
<li>Nerves of steel</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Trade only after 2:30 PM. Watch for clear directional breakout. Volume should confirm move.</p>
<p>Buy ITM option for better delta. Avoid OTM with little time remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Bank Nifty at 49,400 at 2:45 PM. Breaks 49,500 resistance strongly.</p>
<p>Buy 49,300 CE (ITM) at ₹220. Delta is high (0.7+). Tracks Bank Nifty closely.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> ₹50-80 premium gain. Quick profit-taking essential. Don&#39;t hold past 3:20 PM.</p>
<p><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> ₹40-50 loss maximum. Extremely tight required. Volatility is extreme.</p>
<p><strong>Time Exit:</strong> 3:20 PM absolute deadline. Last 10 minutes are pure chaos.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward:</strong> Risk ₹1,200-1,500 per lot. Reward ₹1,500-2,400 per lot. Win rate: 50-55%.</p>

<h2>Timing Your Expiry Day Trades</h2>
<h3>First Hour (9:15-10:15 AM)</h3>
<p>Highest volatility period. Gap openings common. Directional moves establish.</p>
<p><strong>Best Strategies:</strong> OTM option buying for directional plays. Momentum scalping for quick gains.</p>
<p><strong>What to Avoid:</strong> Selling options naked. Range-bound strategies. Gaps invalidate ranges quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus:</strong> Watch opening 15 minutes carefully. Let initial chaos settle. Enter post 9:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Mid-Morning (10:15 AM-12:00 PM)</h3>
<p>Volatility moderates. Ranges often establish. Theta decay accelerates but manageable.</p>
<p><strong>Best Strategies:</strong> Credit spreads for theta collection. ATM scalping for quick moves.</p>
<p><strong>What to Avoid:</strong> Buying far OTM options. Time decay accelerating. Low probability of profit.</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus:</strong> Identify established range. Trade within support-resistance. Don&#39;t fight the range.</p>
<h3>Lunch Hour (12:00-2:00 PM)</h3>
<p>Lowest liquidity. Spreads widen. Theta decay extreme. Avoid trading if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Best Strategies:</strong> Holding winning positions from morning. Avoiding new entries.</p>
<p><strong>What to Avoid:</strong> Initiating new option buying positions. Premium decay too fast now.</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus:</strong> Review morning trades. Plan afternoon strategy. Take break if needed.</p>
<h3>Final Hour (2:00-3:30 PM)</h3>
<p>Maximum chaos. Institutions square off. 500-1000 point moves possible. Extreme risk.</p>
<p><strong>Best Strategies:</strong> Momentum trading with tight stops. Iron butterfly/condor management.</p>

<h2>Risk Management on Expiry Day</h2>
<h3>Rule 1: Smaller Position Sizes</h3>
<p>Regular days: Risk 3% per trade. Expiry day: Risk maximum 2% per trade.</p>
<p>With ₹1 lakh capital, risk only ₹2,000 per trade. Volatility demands extra caution.</p>
<p>Trade 1 lot only if starting. Scale up only after consistent expiry day profits.</p>
<h3>Rule 2: Tighter Stop-Losses</h3>
<p>Regular days: 40-50% stop-loss on premium. Expiry day: 30-40% maximum stop-loss.</p>
<p>Time decay working against you rapidly. Losses compound faster than normal days.</p>
<p>Honor stop-loss instantly. No second chances on expiry day. Market won&#39;t recover for you.</p>
<h3>Rule 3: Time-Based Exits</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t hold losing positions hoping for recovery. Time is your enemy, not friend.</p>
<p>OTM options: Exit by 11:30 AM regardless. ATM options: Exit by 2:00 PM maximum.</p>
<p>Final hour: Only hold if winning significantly. Exit everything by 3:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Rule 4: Maximum 2-3 Trades Per Expiry</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t overtrade expiry day. Emotions run high. Each trade drains mental energy.</p>
<p>Execute 2-3 high-conviction trades maximum. Quality over quantity always.</p>
<p>After 3 trades, stop regardless of outcome. Revenge trading kills accounts.</p>
<h3>Rule 5: Avoid Last 30 Minutes</h3>
<p>Post 3:00 PM, market makers manipulate prices. Bid-ask spreads become ridiculous.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t try capturing last-minute moves. Risk-reward is terrible. Professionals win, retail loses.</p>
<p>Close all positions by 3:20 PM. Take whatever profit/loss exists. Tomorrow is another day.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Expiry Day Mistakes</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Holding OTM Options Till End</strong></p>
<p>Biggest amateur error. OTM options bought at ₹50 hoping to reach ₹200.</p>
<p>Reality: They decay to ₹5-10 by 3 PM. 90% loss guaranteed. Exit early or don&#39;t buy.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Averaging Down Losing Positions</strong></p>
<p>Option bought at ₹100, drops to ₹60. Trader buys more &quot;averaging down.&quot;</p>
<p>Theta decay doesn&#39;t care about your average price. Both positions decay together. Double loss.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Fighting Pin Risk</strong></p>
<p>Bank Nifty at 49,450. Maximum OI at 49,500. Trader keeps buying calls hoping for breakout.</p>
<p>Price gets pinned below 49,500 all day. Calls expire worthless. Respect high OI levels.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Naked Option Selling</strong></p>
<p>Selling options naked without protection. Premium collection looks attractive. Risk is unlimited.</p>
<p>One unexpected move wipes month&#39;s profits. Always use spreads. Define your risk.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: Ignoring Time Decay</strong></p>
<p>Buying ATM option at 1 PM. Thinking &quot;2.5 hours is enough time.&quot;</p>
<p>Theta destroys 70% value in those 2.5 hours. Even correct direction doesn&#39;t profit.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 6: Emotional Trading</strong></p>
<p>Lost ₹10,000 in morning. Trying to recover with risky afternoon trades.</p>
<p>Emotions override logic. Bigger losses follow. Accept morning loss. Stop trading.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Real Expiry Day Trade Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Successful OTM Call Buying</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, October 29, 2025 (Monthly Expiry)</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Bank Nifty gaps up 300 points at opening. Opens at 49,350 vs previous close 49,050.</p>
<p><strong>Entry:</strong> 9:35 AM after 15-minute consolidation confirms bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Buy 49,500 CE at ₹55. Investment = ₹55 × 30 = ₹1,650.</p>
<p><strong>Execution:</strong> Bank Nifty rallies to 49,520 by 10:15 AM. Option premium reaches ₹125.</p>
<p>Exit at ₹125. Profit = (125 - 55) × 30 = ₹2,100 (127% gain).</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 40 minutes. Quick in-and-out execution.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Gap openings with confirmation provide excellent OTM opportunities. Exit fast, don&#39;t be greedy.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Failed ATM Put Buying</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, September 24, 2025 (Monthly Expiry)</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Bank Nifty at 48,900 at 11:30 AM. Showing weakness, breaking support.</p>
<p><strong>Entry:</strong> Buy 48,800 PE at ₹140. Investment = ₹140 × 30 = ₹4,200.</p>
<p><strong>Execution:</strong> Bank Nifty bounces back to 48,950 by 12:30 PM. Option drops to ₹85.</p>
<p>Exit at ₹85 following stop-loss. Loss = (140 - 85) × 30 = ₹1,650 (39% loss).</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour. Followed risk management rules.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Not every setup works. Honor stop-loss. Time decay would have destroyed remaining value by 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Example 3: Successful Credit Spread</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, October 29, 2025 (Monthly Expiry)</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Bank Nifty consolidating 49,200-49,400 range all morning.</p>
<p><strong>Entry:</strong> 11:15 AM. Sell 49,500 CE at ₹95. Buy 49,600 CE at ₹55. Net credit ₹40 × 30 = ₹1,200.</p>
<p><strong>Execution:</strong> Bank Nifty stays below 49,450 entire day. Spread decays beautifully.</p>
<p>Exit at 2:45 PM when spread value is ₹12. Profit = (40 - 12) × 30 = ₹840 (70% of max profit).</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3.5 hours. Theta working in favor.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Range-bound days favor credit spreads. Book 60-70% profit. Don&#39;t wait for 100%.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Understanding Greeks on Expiry Day</h2>
<h3>Delta Changes Rapidly</h3>
<p>Morning: ATM option has delta 0.5. Afternoon: Same option delta swings 0.3-0.7 rapidly.</p>
<p>Small Bank Nifty moves create large delta changes. Your P&amp;L becomes unpredictable.</p>
<p>Trade ITM options if you want stable delta. Avoid OTM with unstable delta.</p>
<h3>Gamma Peaks at ATM</h3>
<p>Expiry day gamma is 3-5x normal days. ATM options have extreme gamma exposure.</p>
<p>50-point Bank Nifty move can double or halve your option value. This is gamma risk.</p>
<p>Avoid selling naked ATM options. Gamma can destroy you in minutes.</p>
<h3>Theta Becomes Dominant</h3>
<p>Regular days: Delta drives P&amp;L. Expiry day: Theta dominates everything.</p>
<p>Even correct directional call loses money due to theta. Buy options only for very strong moves.</p>
<p>Sellers have massive theta advantage. But gamma risk balances it.</p>
<h3>Vega Collapses</h3>
<p>IV (Implied Volatility) drops sharply post 12 PM. Option premiums deflate across board.</p>
<p>Even without price movement, premiums fall 20-30% from IV crush.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t rely on volatility increase to save losing positions. It won&#39;t happen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Bank Nifty expires on the last Tuesday of each month at 3:30 PM. Dynamics differ completely from regular trading days.</p>
<p>Theta decay accelerates exponentially afternoon. Options lose 70-80% value in final 3 hours.</p>
<p>Time-based exits are mandatory. Don&#39;t hold OTM options past 11:30 AM. Exit everything by 3:20 PM.</p>
<p>Position sizing must be smaller. Risk maximum 2% per trade. Trade 1 lot initially.</p>
<p>High OI strikes create pin risk. Price gravitates toward max pain. Respect these levels.</p>
<p>Credit spreads work best mid-morning. Collect premium while defining risk. Book 60-70% profit.</p>
<p>Final hour is for experienced traders only. Extreme volatility and manipulation. Avoid as beginner.</p>
<p>Expiry day demands active monitoring. Set-and-forget doesn&#39;t work. Watch positions continuously.</p>
<p>Most retail traders lose on expiry day. They fight theta and pin risk. Learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>Paper trade expiry day minimum 4 monthly expiries. Understand dynamics before using real money.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Month 1-2:</strong> Watch Bank Nifty expiry day without trading. Note opening, mid-day, closing behavior patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3-4:</strong> Paper trade expiry day strategies. Execute 3-4 paper trades each monthly expiry. Track outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Month 5-6:</strong> Continue paper trading. Try all 5 strategies. Identify which suits your style best.</p>
<p><strong>Month 7:</strong> Start real trading with ₹30,000. Trade only 1 lot. Execute Strategy 1 or 2 initially.</p>
<p><strong>Month 8-10:</strong> Introduce credit spreads if profitable. Trade maximum 2 lots. Maintain strict risk management.</p>
<p><strong>Month 11-12:</strong> Evaluate results. If consistent profitability, scale to 3 lots. If losses, back to paper trading.</p>
<p>Join expiry day trading communities. Share experiences with other traders. Learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>Watch expiry day analysis videos. Understand institutional player tactics. Improve your timing.</p>
<p>Maintain detailed expiry day journal. Note what worked and what failed. Review monthly for patterns.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bank Nifty monthly expiry offers unique opportunities for disciplined traders who understand the extreme dynamics. Time decay acceleration and volatility spikes create conditions unlike any other trading day.</p>
<p>Success requires strict risk management, precise timing, and emotional control. Most traders fail because they hold positions too long fighting inevitable theta decay.</p>
<p>The strategies covered work consistently when executed with discipline. Quick profit-taking and strict stop-losses separate winners from losers on expiry day.</p>
<p>Remember that expiry day isn&#39;t for everyone. If you find it too stressful, focus on regular trading days instead. No shame in avoiding high-risk environments.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q1: What is the biggest difference between Bank Nifty monthly expiry and regular trading days?</strong></p>
<p>Theta decay accelerates 3-4x on expiry day. Options lose 70-80% value in final 3 hours regardless of price movement. Pin risk near high OI strikes is extreme. Volatility spikes unpredictably final hour.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Should beginners trade Bank Nifty expiry day or avoid it completely?</strong></p>
<p>Beginners should paper trade minimum 4 monthly expiries before using real money. Start with very small positions (1 lot). Avoid expiry day completely until you have 6+ months regular options trading experience and consistent profitability.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: What is the best time to trade Bank Nifty options on monthly expiry day?</strong></p>
<p>First hour (9:15-10:30 AM) for directional OTM trades. Mid-morning (10:30 AM-12:00 PM) for credit spreads. Avoid lunch hour (12:00-2:00 PM). Final hour (2:00-3:30 PM) for experienced traders only with tight stops.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Why does Bank Nifty price often settle near high OI strikes on monthly expiry?</strong></p>
<p>Market makers defend high OI strikes where they have maximum positions. They profit if price settles there. This creates &quot;pin risk&quot; - price gravitating toward max pain level. Respect these levels and trade accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: How much capital is needed to trade Bank Nifty expiry day options safely?</strong></p>
<p>Minimum ₹50,000 recommended for safe position sizing. With ₹1 lakh, you can manage 2-3 positions comfortably. Risk maximum 2% per trade (₹2,000 on ₹1 lakh capital). Smaller accounts face higher risk.</p>
