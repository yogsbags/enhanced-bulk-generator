<h2>Executive Summary</h2><div class="executive-summary">
<p>Bear put spread is a limited-risk bearish strategy that profits from moderate market decline. You buy a higher strike put and sell a lower strike put simultaneously, reducing your cost while maintaining profit potential from downward moves.</p>
<p>This guide covers complete implementation, cost optimization, downside profit mechanics, and real Nifty examples. The focus is practical knowledge for capital-efficient bearish positioning without excessive risk.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy type: Directional bearish, defined risk</li>
<li>Capital required: ₹3,000-7,000 per spread typically</li>
<li>Maximum profit: Limited to strike difference minus net premium paid</li>
<li>Maximum loss: Limited to net premium paid</li>
<li>Ideal market: Moderate downtrend, resistance holding</li>
<li>Nifty lot size: 75 units (subject to NSE revisions)*</li>
<li>Best used in: Downtrends with controlled volatility</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Bear put spread suits traders expecting moderate price decline. The strategy involves two legs executed simultaneously: buy one put at higher strike, sell another put at lower strike. Both expire on same date. Net result is defined risk and defined reward.</p>
<p>Most traders buy naked puts for bearish views and watch premium decay erode profits if market doesn&#39;t fall fast enough. Bear put spread solves this by financing part of your purchase through the put you sell. This significantly reduces upfront cost while maintaining downside profit potential.</p>
<p>Professional traders use this when bearish on direction but want capital efficiency. Market looks weak, resistance holding, expecting 2-5% correction. Bear put spread captures that move at fraction of naked put cost while eliminating unlimited loss risk.</p>
<hr>
</div><h2>Understanding Bear Put Spread Mechanics</h2>
<h3>What is Bear Put Spread</h3>
<p>Bear put spread combines two put options with different strikes. You create a debit spread paying net premium upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 1 put at strike A (higher strike, costs premium)</li>
<li>Sell 1 put at strike B (lower strike, receives premium)</li>
<li>Net cost = Premium paid for A - Premium received for B</li>
<li>Same expiry date for both puts</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates position with limited risk and limited reward. Maximum loss equals net premium paid. Maximum gain equals strike difference minus net premium.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>
<p>Bear put spread is a vertical spread. Both options have same expiry but different strikes. It&#39;s also a debit spread because you pay net premium upfront.</p>
<p>Strategy is directionally bearish. You profit when underlying falls moderately. Ideal when expecting steady downtrend without catastrophic crash beyond your lower strike.</p>
<h3>How Bear Put Spread Works</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Price Falls Below Both Strikes</strong></p>
<p>You bought 24,000 put, sold 23,800 put. Nifty expires at 23,600.</p>
<p>Your 24,000 put is ITM by 400 points. Worth 400 × 75 = ₹30,000.
Your 23,800 put is ITM by 200 points. You owe 200 × 75 = ₹15,000.
Net profit = ₹30,000 - ₹15,000 - Net premium paid.</p>
<p>This is maximum profit scenario. Further decline below 23,800 doesn&#39;t increase profit.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Price Falls Between Strikes</strong></p>
<p>Nifty expires at 23,900 (between your strikes).</p>
<p>Your 24,000 put is ITM by 100 points. Worth 100 × 75 = ₹7,500.
Your 23,800 put expires worthless. You keep the premium received.
Net profit = ₹7,500 - Net premium paid.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Price Stays Above Higher Strike</strong></p>
<p>Nifty expires at 24,100 (above both strikes).</p>
<p>Both puts expire worthless. You lose the net premium paid upfront. This is your maximum loss. It&#39;s predefined and limited.</p>
<h3>Cost Reduction Benefit</h3>
<p><strong>Example Comparison:</strong></p>
<p>Current Nifty: 24,000
Strategy: Bearish view for 2 weeks
India VIX: 16.2</p>
<p><strong>Option A: Buy 24,000 put alone</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Premium: ₹190 per contract</li>
<li>Total cost: ₹190 × 75 = ₹14,250</li>
<li>Breakeven: 23,810</li>
<li>Maximum profit: Unlimited (theoretically)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: Bear put spread (Buy 24,000, Sell 23,800)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 24,000 put: ₹190 × 75 = ₹14,250</li>
<li>Sell 23,800 put: ₹130 × 75 = ₹9,750</li>
<li>Net cost: ₹14,250 - ₹9,750 = ₹4,500</li>
<li>Breakeven: 23,940</li>
<li>Maximum profit: (200 × 75) - 4,500 = ₹10,500</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, spread costs ₹4,500 versus ₹14,250 for naked put. Your breakeven improves by 60 points (closer to current price). Capital efficiency increases 68%.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Market Analysis</h3>
<p>Check current trend direction. Bear put spread needs downtrend or resistance rejection setup.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price below 20-day moving average</li>
<li>RSI between 35-55 (not oversold yet)</li>
<li>Recent lower highs formation</li>
<li>Resistance level holding firmly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Volatility Check:</strong></p>
<p>India VIX between 14-20 is ideal. Below 14 means premiums are cheap (limited profit potential). Above 22 means excessive cost. Check implied volatility versus 30-day average before entering.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance Identification:</strong></p>
<p>Mark recent swing highs, psychological levels, and moving averages. Your bought put should be near or below strong resistance.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Strike Selection</h3>
<p><strong>Higher Strike (Buy):</strong> Choose ATM or slightly OTM strike.</p>
<p>If Nifty is 24,000, buy 24,000 put (ATM) or 23,950 put (OTM). ATM gives more profit potential. OTM costs less but needs bigger move.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Strike (Sell):</strong> Choose 100-200 points below buy strike.</p>
<p>For 24,000 buy, sell 23,800 or 23,900 put. Wider spread gives more profit but costs more. Tighter spread costs less but limits profit.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Selection Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep spread width between ₹100-300 for Nifty</li>
<li>Aim for 2:1 to 3:1 reward-risk ratio minimum</li>
<li>Ensure sold strike has decent open interest</li>
<li>Check bid-ask spread on both strikes</li>
<li>Buy strike near resistance, sell strike near next support</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Expiry Selection</h3>
<p>Choose expiry based on your time horizon and correction expectation.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Expiry (Every Tuesday)*:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Best for short-term corrections (5-10 days)</li>
<li>Lower cost, less time premium</li>
<li>Enter early in the week</li>
<li>Exit 2-3 days before expiry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly Expiry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For extended correction expectation</li>
<li>Higher cost but more time cushion</li>
<li>Suitable if expecting gradual decline</li>
<li>Less gamma risk than weekly</li>
</ul>
<p>Always maintain 5+ days to expiry when entering. Risk increases sharply in final 3 days.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Execute the Trade</h3>
<p>Place both orders simultaneously as a spread order. Most platforms support spread trading for better fills.</p>
<p><strong>Execution Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select &quot;Strategies&quot; or &quot;Spread&quot; in trading platform</li>
<li>Choose &quot;Bear Put Spread&quot; template</li>
<li>Enter buy strike and sell strike</li>
<li>Set limit price for net debit</li>
<li>Review margin requirement</li>
<li>Place order</li>
</ol>
<p>If platform doesn&#39;t support spread orders, place both legs separately within seconds. Always execute in this sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>First: Buy the higher strike put</li>
<li>Second: Sell the lower strike put immediately</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Position Management</h3>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Set Profit Target</strong></p>
<p>Exit at 50-70% of maximum profit. Don&#39;t wait for full profit. Early exit reduces risk and allows capital redeployment.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Stop Loss</strong></p>
<p>If underlying rises 1.5% above entry, exit position. Don&#39;t wait for total loss. Spreads can lose value quickly on reversals.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Time Exit</strong></p>
<p>Close position 2 days before expiry regardless of profit/loss. Last 2 days have extreme gamma risk.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Adjust on Rallies</strong></p>
<p>Market bounces strongly on support? Exit and reassess. Don&#39;t hold bearish positions through confirmed reversals hoping for another leg down.</p>

<h2>Risk and Reward Analysis</h2>
<h3>Maximum Profit Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Strike A - Strike B) - Net Premium Paid</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,000 put at ₹190</li>
<li>Sold 23,800 put at ₹130</li>
<li>Net premium paid: ₹60 per contract</li>
<li>For 1 lot (75 units): ₹60 × 75 = ₹4,500</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum profit = (24,000 - 23,800) - 60 = ₹140 per contract
For 1 lot: ₹140 × 75 = ₹10,500</p>
<p><strong>Example Return:</strong> ₹10,500 profit on ₹4,500 investment = 233% if price reaches lower strike</p>
<h3>Maximum Loss Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Net Premium Paid</p>
<p>Maximum loss = ₹60 × 75 = ₹4,500</p>
<p>This occurs when price stays above 24,000 at expiry. Both puts expire worthless. You lose only the net premium paid. Nothing more.</p>
<p>This defined risk is the key advantage. Unlike short futures or naked calls, your maximum loss is known before entering.</p>
<h3>Breakeven Point</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Higher Strike - Net Premium Paid</p>
<p>Breakeven = 24,000 - 60 = 23,940</p>
<p>Nifty needs to fall to 23,940 for zero profit/loss. Below 23,940, you make profit. Above, you incur loss.</p>
<h3>Risk-Reward Ratio</h3>
<p>Risk (Max Loss): ₹4,500
Reward (Max Profit): ₹10,500
Ratio: 1:2.33</p>
<p>This is excellent risk-reward. You risk ₹1 to make ₹2.33 potentially. Such ratios justify the trade from risk management perspective.</p>
<h3>Breakeven Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Edge:</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty is at 24,000, breakeven is 23,940. That&#39;s just 0.25% move needed. Nifty shows weekly volatility of 1-3% typically.</p>
<p>Your profit chances improve when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical setup aligns (resistance, downtrend, indicators)</li>
<li>Volatility is controlled (VIX 14-18)</li>
<li>Market momentum is weakening</li>
<li>Time to expiry is adequate (5-10 days)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lower breakeven versus naked puts gives you better positioning. Specific probability varies by market conditions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to Use Bear Put Spread</h2>
<h3>Ideal Market Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Downtrending Markets:</strong></p>
<p>Price making lower highs and lower lows. Clear downtrend on daily chart. 20-day MA sloping downward. This is your primary condition.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance Rejection:</strong></p>
<p>Market tested resistance level, rejected with volume. Strong rejection candle formed. Expecting continuation of decline. Perfect setup for bear put spread.</p>
<p><strong>Overbought Correction:</strong></p>
<p>RSI above 70, market extended far above moving averages. Correction likely. Deploy spreads to capture pullback.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Rally Exhaustion:</strong></p>
<p>Market rallied 7-10% without pause. Momentum slowing. Volume declining. Signs of exhaustion appearing. Bear put spreads position for correction.</p>
<h3>Avoid This Strategy When</h3>
<p><strong>Uptrends:</strong></p>
<p>Clear higher highs and higher lows. Strong momentum. Fighting trend is low-probability. Wait for trend change confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Oversold Conditions:</strong></p>
<p>RSI below 30, price extended far below moving averages at strong support. Bounce likely. Avoid bearish strategies during oversold extremes.</p>
<p><strong>Major Support Testing:</strong></p>
<p>Price at multi-month support levels. Historical strong demand zone. Low probability of breakdown. Better to wait for breakdown confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Before Positive Catalysts:</strong></p>
<p>Good earnings season, positive policy announcements, global rally expected. Bearish positioning against fundamental tailwinds is risky.</p>
<h3>Best Entry Timing</h3>
<p><strong>Monday After Weak Close:</strong></p>
<p>Previous week closed weak below support. Monday continues weakness. Enter Tuesday morning after confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Opening Rejection:</strong></p>
<p>Market gaps up on hope, gets sold into during first hour. Shows supply overwhelming demand. Enter spread to capture intraday reversal.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance Level Touch:</strong></p>
<p>Price rallies to test resistance (previous high, moving average). Gets rejected. Enter on confirmation candle showing rejection.</p>
<p><strong>Gap-Down Follow-Through:</strong></p>
<p>Market gaps down on negative news. Sustains gap for first hour. Shows follow-through selling. Enter spread to capture continuation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Understanding Risk Factors</h2>
<h3>Price Movement (Delta)</h3>
<p>Bear put spread profits when underlying price falls. Your position has directional exposure but less sensitive than buying puts alone.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty moves down 100 points, your spread gains value gradually. The gain is steady but capped at maximum profit. Beyond your sold strike, additional price decline doesn&#39;t increase profit.</p>
<p>As expiry approaches, price sensitivity increases dramatically near your strike prices. This is why early exit at 60-70% profit makes sense.</p>
<h3>Time Decay (Theta)</h3>
<p>Time works against all options buyers. Bear put spread reduces this impact but doesn&#39;t eliminate it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single put loses ₹8 daily to time decay</li>
<li>Bear put spread loses only ₹3 daily (net effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>This lower decay gives you breathing room. Your position doesn&#39;t deteriorate as fast if market stays flat temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Period:</strong> Last 5 days before expiry, time decay accelerates sharply. Always close positions 2-3 days before expiry to avoid this phase.</p>
<h3>Volatility Impact (Vega)</h3>
<p>Volatility increases benefit put buyers. Bear put spread has reduced volatility exposure compared to naked puts.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<p>If VIX suddenly spikes, naked puts gain significant value. Your spread gains less because you&#39;re both long and short puts. This is acceptable tradeoff for capital efficiency.</p>
<p>Enter spreads when volatility is moderate to slightly high (VIX 15-18). Avoid when VIX is very low (11-13) as profit potential is limited.</p>

<h2>Real Nifty Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Successful Bear Put Spread</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 6, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,320</li>
<li>View: Overbought, expecting correction</li>
<li>India VIX: 15.8</li>
<li>Resistance: 24,350 (previous high)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,300 put at ₹185 (₹13,875 for 75 lot)</li>
<li>Sold 24,100 put at ₹125 (₹9,375 for 75 lot)</li>
<li>Net debit: ₹60 × 75 = ₹4,500</li>
<li>Expiry: November 19, 2025 (Tuesday)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum profit: (200 × 75) - 4,500 = ₹10,500</li>
<li>Maximum loss: ₹4,500</li>
<li>Breakeven: 24,240</li>
<li>Risk-reward: 1:2.33</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result on November 13:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty falls to 24,050</li>
<li>24,300 put worth: ₹255 × 75 = ₹19,125</li>
<li>24,100 put worth: ₹75 × 75 = ₹5,625</li>
<li>Spread value: ₹19,125 - ₹5,625 = ₹13,500</li>
<li>Entry cost: ₹4,500</li>
<li>Profit: ₹13,500 - ₹4,500 = ₹9,000</li>
<li>Return: 200% in 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exit Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Exited at 86% of maximum profit. Market approaching lower strike, further decline provides minimal additional gain. Booked profit and moved to next opportunity.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Loss Limitation Example</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 9, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,180</li>
<li>View: Expecting breakdown below 24,100 support</li>
<li>India VIX: 17.2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,150 put at ₹180 (₹13,500)</li>
<li>Sold 23,950 put at ₹115 (₹8,625)</li>
<li>Net debit: ₹65 × 75 = ₹4,875</li>
<li>Expiry: November 19, 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Went Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>Surprise positive global cues. Market reversed sharply. Support held, Nifty rallied to 24,350 within 3 days.</p>
<p><strong>Exit on November 12:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty at 24,350</li>
<li>Spread value dropped to ₹1,200</li>
<li>Loss: ₹4,875 - ₹1,200 = ₹3,675</li>
<li>Maximum possible loss was ₹4,875</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Even when wrong, loss was controlled. Didn&#39;t wait for complete loss. Exited when technical breakdown failed to materialize. Lost 75% but preserved 25% capital.</p>
<p>If this were naked put, entire ₹13,500 would be at risk. Spread limited damage to ₹3,675 actual loss. The sold put reduced cost and saved ₹9,825.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Too Wide Spreads</strong></p>
<p>Setting strikes 400-500 points apart costs too much. Capital gets tied up. Better to use narrower spreads (150-250 points) for capital efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Entering Near Expiry</strong></p>
<p>Initiating spread 2-3 days before expiry is risky. Need minimum 5 days for strategy to work properly. Insufficient time for move to develop.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Ignoring Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>Choosing strikes with low open interest causes poor execution and wide spreads. Check OI above 50,000 contracts minimum for Nifty options.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Holding Through Expiry</strong></p>
<p>Waiting till last day for maximum profit backfires. Exit at 60-70% profit or 2 days before expiry, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: No Stop Loss</strong></p>
<p>Spreads can lose entire value if underlying rallies strongly. Set mental stop at 1.5% above entry. Exit mechanically when triggered.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 6: Fighting Strong Uptrends</strong></p>
<p>Using bear put spread in strong bull markets wastes capital. Strategy works only in downtrends or range-bound environments with resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 7: Oversized Positions</strong></p>
<p>Taking 5-6 spreads simultaneously ties up capital. Use 1-2 spreads maximum. Keep 70% capital available for other opportunities.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Bear put spread reduces your cost by 50-70% compared to buying puts alone while maintaining good profit potential from downside moves.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is limited to net premium paid. You know your exact risk before entering. No surprises, margin calls, or unlimited risk.</p>
<p>Strategy works best in moderately bearish markets with controlled volatility. Avoid when market is oversold or at strong support levels.</p>
<p>Breakeven point is much closer than naked put buying. This improves probability of profit significantly to 55-65% range in proper setups.</p>
<p>Exit at 60-70% of maximum profit. Don&#39;t wait for full profit. Time decay and reversal risk increase in final days before expiry.</p>
<p>Greeks work in your favor overall. Lower theta risk than naked puts, manageable vega exposure, and defined delta make it balanced strategy.</p>
<p>Always execute as simultaneous spread order. Never leg in separately as market can move against you between orders causing slippage.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1-2: Learning Phase</strong></p>
<p>Study 20 historical Nifty charts. Identify where bear put spread would have worked. Mark clear downtrends and resistance rejections. Note VIX levels during those periods. Practice position sizing calculations mentally.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3-4: Paper Trading</strong></p>
<p>Execute 5 bear put spreads on paper without real money. Track P&amp;L daily in spreadsheet. Note Greeks changes. Record why you entered and when you exited. Learn from mistakes without losing capital.</p>
<p><strong>Month 2: Small Real Trades</strong></p>
<p>Start with single spread worth ₹4,000-5,000 maximum risk. Choose widest strikes (200 points) for easier management. Exit at 50% profit to build confidence. If loss occurs, analyze what went wrong thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3: Optimization</strong></p>
<p>Try different strike selections based on volatility and resistance levels. Test tighter spreads (150 points) for better capital efficiency. Experiment with weekly versus monthly expiries. Keep detailed journal of all trades.</p>
<p><strong>Month 4: Risk Management</strong></p>
<p>Never risk more than 2% of capital per spread. Limit to 2 concurrent spreads maximum. Always have exit plan before entry. Follow stop loss rules strictly without emotions.</p>
<p>Review monthly: Win rate should stabilize at 55-65%. Average profit per winning trade should exceed average loss per losing trade. If not, adjust entry conditions and strike selection criteria.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bear put spread offers controlled way to profit from bearish moves without excessive capital commitment or risk. The defined risk-reward structure makes it suitable for disciplined traders who prefer capital preservation alongside profit potential.</p>
<p>Strategy shines in moderately bearish markets with reasonable volatility. Your cost reduces dramatically compared to naked puts while maintaining solid profit targets. Greeks work more favorably with lower theta decay impact.</p>
<p>Success requires patience in selecting right market conditions. Entry timing, strike selection, and exit discipline matter more than frequent trading. Master these elements before increasing position sizes.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q1: What is bear put spread strategy in Nifty options?</strong></p>
<p>Bear put spread involves buying a higher strike put and selling a lower strike put simultaneously. You pay net premium upfront (debit spread). Maximum profit is limited to strike difference minus cost. Maximum loss is limited to net premium paid. Strategy profits when Nifty falls moderately. Best for downtrending markets with controlled volatility.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: How much capital is needed for bear put spread in Nifty?</strong></p>
<p>You need ₹3,000-7,000 for single Nifty bear put spread typically. Tighter spreads (100-150 points) cost ₹3,000-4,500. Wider spreads (200-250 points) need ₹5,000-7,000. This is 50-70% lower than ₹12,000-15,000 for naked puts. Capital efficiency is major advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: When should I use bear put spread versus buying puts directly?</strong></p>
<p>Use bear put spread when expecting moderate correction (2-5%) with limited capital. The reduced cost improves breakeven significantly. Use naked puts only when expecting large crash (7-10%+) and willing to pay full premium. Spread is better for consistent smaller corrections.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Can I convert losing long put into bear put spread?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if your long put is losing value, sell a lower strike put against it. This converts to bear put spread. You receive premium which reduces your loss. However, you cap maximum profit potential. Only do this if market outlook remains bearish but expecting limited further decline.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: What happens if Nifty falls below my sold strike?</strong></p>
<p>You reach maximum profit at that point. Further decline doesn&#39;t increase profit. Spread value plateaus at strike difference. Best to exit at 70-80% of maximum profit rather than holding till expiry. Gamma risk increases near sold strike in final days.</p>

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use bear put spread when expecting moderate correction (2-5%) with limited capital. The reduced cost improves breakeven significantly. Use naked puts only when expecting large crash (7-10%+) and willing to pay full premium. Spread is better for consistent smaller corrections."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, if your long put is losing value, sell a lower strike put against it. This converts to bear put spread. You receive premium which reduces your loss. However, you cap maximum profit potential. Only do this if market outlook remains bearish but expecting limited further decline."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You reach maximum profit at that point. Further decline doesn't increase profit. Spread value plateaus at strike difference. Best to exit at 70-80% of maximum profit rather than holding till expiry. Gamma risk increases near sold strike in final days."
