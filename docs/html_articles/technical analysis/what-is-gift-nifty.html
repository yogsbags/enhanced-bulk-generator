<h1>What is GIFT Nifty? New Trading Hours, Contract Specs &amp; Strategy (2025 Guide)</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article covers the complete landscape of <strong>GIFT Nifty</strong>, the new global benchmark for Indian equities that replaced SGX Nifty. We analyze its 21-hour trading cycle, contract specifications for November 2025, and the strategic &quot;Connect&quot; mechanism between NSE and SGX. The analysis reveals how this shift to Gandhinagar&#39;s GIFT City impacts liquidity, offers tax benefits for foreign investors, and serves as a critical pre-market indicator for domestic traders.</p>
<p>If you have been tracking Indian markets before 9:15 AM, you likely looked at SGX Nifty. That era is over. Today, the pulse of India&#39;s pre-market sentiment beats in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, under a new identity: <strong>GIFT Nifty</strong>. For the mass affluent investor or the salaried professional managing a portfolio in FY 2025-26, understanding this instrument is no longer optional—it is essential for gauging market gaps and global sentiment.</p>
<h2>What are the Timings of GIFT Nifty and SGX Nifty?</h2>
<p>The most significant advantage of GIFT Nifty is its extended trading window, which covers nearly every major global market time zone. Unlike the domestic Nifty 50, which trades for just 6 hours and 15 minutes, GIFT Nifty operates for approximately 21 hours daily.</p>
<p>As of November 2025, the trading schedule on the NSE International Exchange (NSE IX) is divided into two strategic sessions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Session</th>
<th align="left">Time (IST)</th>
<th align="left">Market Overlap</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Session 1</strong></td>
<td align="left">06:30 AM – 03:40 PM</td>
<td align="left">Asian Markets (Tokyo, Hong Kong) &amp; European Open (London)</td>

<td align="left">04:35 PM – 02:45 AM</td>
<td align="left">US Markets (New York) &amp; Post-Market Global Events</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Why this matters to you:</strong>
If you are a domestic investor, the 06:30 AM start time is your first reliable signal of how the Nifty 50 might open. While the previous SGX Nifty also offered early signals, GIFT Nifty&#39;s Session 2 ensures that late-night developments in the US (like Federal Reserve rate decisions) are priced in immediately, rather than waiting for the next morning.</p>
<h2>How will Investors Gain from GIFT Nifty?</h2>
<p>The transition to GIFT City is not just a rebranding exercise; it is a structural upgrade designed to benefit different classes of investors in distinct ways.</p>
<h3>1. For Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and NRIs</h3>
<p>The primary beneficiaries are international investors. Trading in GIFT City (India&#39;s first International Financial Services Centre or IFSC) comes with significant tax efficiency. As per current IFSC regulations (November 2025), eligible foreign investors enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero Capital Gains Tax:</strong> No tax on profits from derivatives trading.</li>
<li><strong>Zero STT and GST:</strong> Securities Transaction Tax and Commodities Transaction Tax are waived.</li>
<li><strong>Dollar Denomination:</strong> Contracts are settled in USD, eliminating immediate currency risk for foreign funds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. For Domestic Retail Investors</h3>
<p>Here is the reality check: <strong>Indian retail investors cannot trade GIFT Nifty directly</strong> for speculative purposes. As per the Reserve Bank of India&#39;s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) guidelines, remitting funds for leveraged derivative trading abroad (even in GIFT City) is prohibited.</p>
<p>However, you gain indirectly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better Price Discovery:</strong> With liquidity concentrated in India rather than split between Singapore and Mumbai, the pre-market signals are sharper.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Volatility:</strong> The &quot;Connect&quot; mechanism ensures that large foreign orders are matched within India&#39;s regulatory framework, potentially reducing wild arbitrage swings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Will Happen to SGX Nifty?</h2>
<p>For over two decades, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) was the offshore home for Nifty futures. It was the go-to hedging tool for foreign investors who didn&#39;t want to navigate India&#39;s onshore tax and registration complexities. However, this created a &quot;liquidity export&quot; problem—trading volumes that belonged to India were happening in Singapore.</p>
<p>Effective July 3, 2023, the SGX Nifty was officially discontinued and rebranded as GIFT Nifty. All open positions were migrated to the NSE International Exchange (NSE IX). Today, if you search for &quot;SGX Nifty&quot; on a terminal, you are redirected to GIFT Nifty data. The product you knew is gone; the liquidity has come home.</p>
<h2>Difference Between SGX Nifty and GIFT Nifty</h2>
<p>While the underlying asset (Nifty 50 Index) remains the same, the structural and regulatory environment has shifted completely. Here is how they compare in the current landscape:</p>

<h2>Where Can You Access GIFT Nifty Data?</h2>
<p>Since you cannot trade it directly through your standard demat account, accessing the data is your primary interaction with GIFT Nifty. As of November 2025, real-time data is available through:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NSE IX Website:</strong> The official exchange website provides delayed quotes and turnover data.</li>
<li><strong>Financial News Terminals:</strong> Platforms like Bloomberg and Refinitiv Eikon stream real-time tick-by-tick data.</li>
<li><strong>Broker Terminals:</strong> Most top-tier Indian brokers now display &quot;GIFT Nifty&quot; (formerly labelled SGX Nifty) on their market watch screens as an index ticker.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Look for the ticker symbol <strong>GIFTNIFTY</strong> or <strong>NIFTY_IX</strong> depending on your data provider. The price you see is the futures price, which will typically trade at a premium or discount to the Nifty 50 spot price due to the &quot;cost of carry&quot; (interest rate differential between USD and INR).</p>
<h2>Why is SGX Nifty Being Shifted to GIFT Nifty?</h2>
<p>The shift was driven by a strategic need for <strong>financial sovereignty</strong>. In 2018, tensions rose when SGX planned to launch new Indian derivative products, which Indian exchanges felt would cannibalize domestic liquidity. This led to a legal standoff, eventually resolved by the &quot;GIFT Connect&quot; compromise.</p>
<p>The logic is simple: If the underlying asset is Indian (Nifty 50 companies), the trading, clearing, and settlement should happen within India&#39;s legal jurisdiction. This move:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Onshores Liquidity:</strong> Brings billions of dollars in daily turnover ($106.22 billion in October 2025) back to Indian soil.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Control:</strong> Gives the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) oversight on foreign flows.</li>
<li><strong>Boosts GIFT City:</strong> Validates Gandhinagar as a credible global financial hub comparable to Dubai or Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How will the GIFT Nifty Be Exchanged?</h2>
<p>The trading mechanism is powered by a unique pipeline called the <strong>NSE IX-SGX Connect</strong>. Here is how a trade flows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Order Entry:</strong> A foreign investor in London places an order for Nifty futures through their broker in Singapore (SGX member).</li>
<li><strong>Routing:</strong> The order is not matched in Singapore. Instead, it is routed instantly via a high-speed pipe to the NSE International Exchange (NSE IX) in GIFT City.</li>
<li><strong>Matching:</strong> The order meets other orders (from India or elsewhere) and is matched at NSE IX.</li>
<li><strong>Clearing:</strong> The trade is cleared by the NSE International Clearing Corporation (NICCL).</li>
<li><strong>Settlement:</strong> The investor gets their confirmation in Singapore, and the settlement happens in USD.</li>
</ol>
<p>This seamless backend integration means the investor&#39;s experience remains unchanged, but the actual &quot;exchange&quot; of the contract happens in India.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Identity:</strong> SGX Nifty is now <strong>GIFT Nifty</strong>, trading from Gandhinagar, Gujarat.</li>
