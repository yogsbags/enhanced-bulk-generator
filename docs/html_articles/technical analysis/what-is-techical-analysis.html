<h1>What is technical analysis?</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article covers the essentials of <strong>technical analysis</strong> for Indian investors in the FY 2025-26 landscape. We examine how price action, volume data, and chart patterns help identify high-probability trading opportunities in stocks and indices like Nifty 50. The analysis reveals that while technical tools are powerful, they must be paired with strict risk management—especially given the current Securities Transaction Tax (STT) rate of 0.1% on options and 0.02% on futures. We also explore how recent SEBI regulations on algorithmic trading and research analysts impact your trading strategy.</p>
<p>Technical analysis is often misunderstood as crystal-ball gazing. In reality, it is the study of market psychology through the lens of price and volume data. Unlike fundamental analysis, which calculates what a stock <em>should</em> be worth based on earnings and audits, technical analysis focuses on what the market is <em>actually</em> paying for it right now. For an Indian trader navigating volatile sessions in November 2025, mastering these charts is not about predicting the future—it is about managing probability and risk. Whether you are tracking the Nifty 50 or analyzing mid-cap breakouts, the charts reveal the collective sentiment of lakhs of market participants.</p>
<h2>The Core Philosophy: Why Charts Work</h2>
<p>Technical analysis relies on three foundational principles, originally derived from Dow Theory, which remain relevant for Indian markets in 2025.</p>
<h3>1. The Market Discounts Everything</h3>
<p>This principle suggests that the current price of a stock already reflects all known information—earnings reports, RBI interest rate decisions, geopolitical tensions, and even insider sentiment. For example, if a company is expected to post poor quarterly results, the stock price often drops <em>before</em> the official announcement. As a technical trader, you don&#39;t need to read every news report; you simply analyze the price movement which aggregates this data.</p>
<h3>2. Prices Move in Trends</h3>
<p>Markets do not move in straight lines, but they do move in trends. A stock is more likely to continue its current direction than to reverse it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uptrend:</strong> Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL).</li>
<li><strong>Downtrend:</strong> Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL).</li>
<li><strong>Sideways (Consolidation):</strong> Price moves within a horizontal range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying the trend early is the primary goal of technical analysis. As the old Dalal Street adage goes, &quot;The trend is your friend until it bends.&quot;</p>
<h3>3. History Repeats Itself</h3>
<p>Human psychology—fear and greed—has not changed in centuries. Chart patterns that appeared in 1990 often appear in 2025 because investors react similarly to panic or euphoria. A &quot;Head and Shoulders&quot; pattern that signaled a market top ten years ago is statistically likely to signal a top today.</p>
<h2>Essential Chart Types for Indian Traders</h2>
<p>While modern software offers dozens of chart types, three dominate the Indian trading landscape.</p>
<h3>Japanese Candlestick Charts</h3>
<p>This is the default for most professionals. Each candlestick tells you four key data points for a specific timeframe (e.g., 1 day, 15 minutes):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> The price at the start of the session.</li>
<li><strong>High:</strong> The highest price reached.</li>
<li><strong>Low:</strong> The lowest price reached.</li>
<li><strong>Close:</strong> The final price.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;body&quot; of the candle shows the range between open and close, while the &quot;wicks&quot; (or shadows) show the high and low. A green body indicates the price closed higher than it opened (bullish), while a red body indicates it closed lower (bearish).</p>
<h3>Heikin-Ashi Charts</h3>
<p>&quot;Heikin-Ashi&quot; means &quot;average bar&quot; in Japanese. These charts smooth out price action by using average data, filtering out market noise.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Identifying clear trends without getting spooked by minor pullbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> You lose exact price data for the current candle, so they are better for trend-following than precise entry.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Line Charts</h3>
<p>A simple line connecting closing prices. While it lacks detail (ignoring highs and lows), it is excellent for identifying long-term support and resistance levels without visual clutter.</p>
<h2>Top Technical Indicators (And How to Use Them)</h2>
<p>Indicators are mathematical calculations based on price and volume. In FY 2025-26, these are the most widely used indicators on NSE and BSE stocks.</p>
<h3>1. Moving Averages (MA)</h3>
<p>Moving averages smooth out price data to identify the trend direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Moving Average (SMA):</strong> The average price over a set period. The <strong>200-day SMA</strong> is the &quot;holy grail&quot; of long-term trends. If Nifty is above the 200-day SMA, the long-term trend is bullish.</li>
<li><strong>Exponential Moving Average (EMA):</strong> Gives more weight to recent prices. The <strong>50-day EMA</strong> is popular for medium-term trend identification.</li>
<li><strong>Crossover Strategy:</strong> A &quot;Golden Cross&quot; occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses <em>above</em> the 200-day SMA, signaling a potential major rally.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h3>
<p>RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overbought (&gt;70):</strong> The stock may be overvalued and due for a correction.</li>
<li><strong>Oversold (&lt;30):</strong> The stock may be undervalued and due for a bounce.</li>
<li><strong>Divergence:</strong> If price makes a new high but RSI makes a lower high, it signals weakening momentum—a powerful reversal warning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</h3>
<p>A trend-following momentum indicator. It consists of the MACD line, the Signal line, and a Histogram.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buy Signal:</strong> When the MACD line crosses <em>above</em> the Signal line.</li>
<li><strong>Sell Signal:</strong> When the MACD line crosses <em>below</em> the Signal line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Bollinger Bands</h3>
<p>Consists of a middle band (usually a 20-day SMA) and two outer bands representing standard deviation (volatility).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squeeze:</strong> When bands contract, volatility is low, often preceding a violent breakout.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> When bands widen, the trend is strong.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Critical Chart Patterns to Master</h2>
<p>Patterns are recognizable shapes in price charts that suggest future movement.</p>
<h3>Reversal Patterns</h3>
<p>These signal that the current trend is ending.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head and Shoulders:</strong> A peak (head) flanked by two smaller peaks (shoulders). A break below the &quot;neckline&quot; signals a bearish reversal.</li>
<li><strong>Double Top/Bottom:</strong> The price tests a level twice and fails to break it. A &quot;Double Bottom&quot; (W-shape) is bullish; a &quot;Double Top&quot; (M-shape) is bearish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Continuation Patterns</h3>
<p>These signal that the trend will resume after a pause.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flags and Pennants:</strong> A sharp move (pole) followed by a short consolidation (flag). The breakout usually happens in the direction of the original move.</li>
<li><strong>Cup and Handle:</strong> A bullish pattern resembling a tea cup. The breakout above the handle suggests an upward move.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Management in the 2025 Regulatory Era</h2>
<p>Technical analysis provides the entry signal, but risk management ensures survival. With the <strong>STT on options increased to 0.1%</strong> and <strong>futures to 0.02%</strong> (effective October 2024), your profit margins must account for higher transaction costs. Precision is key.</p>
<h3>The 2% Rule</h3>
<p>Never risk more than 2% of your total trading capital on a single trade. If you have ₹5 lakh capital, your maximum loss on one trade should not exceed ₹10,000.</p>
<h3>Stop Loss (SL) is Non-Negotiable</h3>
<p>A Stop Loss is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical SL:</strong> Placed below a key support level or moving average.</li>
<li><strong>Trailing SL:</strong> Moves up as the stock price rises, locking in profits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regulatory Awareness (November 2025 Context)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SEBI Registered Analysts Only:</strong> As per the <strong>SEBI Master Circular for Research Analysts (June 2025)</strong>, strict norms govern who can give buy/sell recommendations. Avoid unregistered &quot;finfluencers&quot; on Telegram or YouTube. Rely on advice from SEBI-registered professionals or your own analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Algo Trading:</strong> If you use algorithmic tools for technical trading, note that as of <strong>October 1, 2025</strong>, retail algorithms require mandatory broker approval. Ensure your tools are compliant.</li>
<li><strong>Lot Size Changes:</strong> As per NSE circulars, the <strong>Nifty 50 lot size is 75 units</strong> (as of November 2025), but is scheduled to reduce to <strong>65 units effective December 30, 2025</strong>. Adjust your position sizing calculations accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Many successful investors use a hybrid approach—Fundamental for &quot;what&quot; to buy, and Technical for &quot;when&quot; to buy.</em></p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price Discounts Everything:</strong> Technical analysis assumes current prices reflect all available information.</li>
<li><strong>Trend Identification:</strong> Use Higher Highs/Lows for uptrends and Lower Highs/Lows for downtrends.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Always use a Stop Loss. The 2% rule protects your capital from ruin.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Check:</strong> Verify Nifty lot sizes (currently 75, changing to 65 in Dec 2025) and factor in the 0.1% STT on options.</li>
<li><strong>Indicator Discipline:</strong> Don&#39;t clutter your chart. Use 2-3 indicators (e.g., RSI + EMA) to avoid &quot;analysis paralysis.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Follow SEBI-registered advice and avoid unauthorized tips.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Month 1: The Foundation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open a charting platform (like TradingView or your broker&#39;s terminal).</li>
<li>Add the <strong>50-day and 200-day SMA</strong> to the Nifty 50 chart.</li>
<li>Observe how price reacts at these levels over the last 5 years.</li>
<li>Practice identifying &quot;Higher Highs&quot; and &quot;Lower Lows&quot; on daily charts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 2: Paper Trading</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select 5 liquid stocks (e.g., Reliance, HDFC Bank, Infosys).</li>
<li>Apply the <strong>RSI indicator</strong> (14-period). Mark zones above 70 and below 30.</li>
<li>&quot;Paper trade&quot; (simulate without real money) whenever RSI creates a divergence.</li>
<li>Record your entry, stop loss, and exit prices in a journal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 3: Live Execution (Small Capital)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allocate a small portion of capital (e.g., ₹10,000).</li>
<li>Execute trades based <em>only</em> on a defined setup (e.g., Price &gt; 50 EMA + RSI &gt; 50).</li>
<li>Strictly adhere to a <strong>1:2 Risk-Reward Ratio</strong> (risk ₹1 to make ₹2).</li>
<li>Review your journal weekly to identify emotional errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs on Technical Analysis</h2>
<h3>What is the best timeframe for technical analysis?</h3>
<p>The best timeframe depends on your trading style. Intraday traders typically use <strong>5-minute or 15-minute charts</strong>, while swing traders prefer <strong>Daily or 4-hour charts</strong>. Long-term investors should focus on <strong>Weekly charts</strong> to filter out short-term noise and identify major trends.</p>
<h3>Can technical analysis apply to mutual funds?</h3>
<p>Generally, no. Mutual funds are long-term investment vehicles priced once a day (NAV). Technical analysis requires real-time price fluctuation and volume data to be effective. It is best suited for <strong>stocks, indices (Nifty/Sensex), commodities, and currencies</strong> where active trading occurs.</p>
<h3>How does the 2025 STT increase affect technical traders?</h3>
<p>With STT on options hiked to <strong>0.1%</strong> and futures to <strong>0.02%</strong>, the breakeven point for trades has increased. Scalpers (who take small profits) are most affected. You must ensure your technical targets offer enough profit margin to cover these higher statutory costs.</p>
<h3>Is technical analysis reliable for small-cap stocks?</h3>
<p>Technical analysis works best on liquid stocks with high volume. Small-cap stocks with low liquidity can be easily manipulated (&quot;pump and dump&quot;), leading to false chart signals. It is safer to apply technical analysis to <strong>Nifty 50 or Nifty Next 50</strong> stocks.</p>
<h3>Do I need expensive software for technical analysis?</h3>
<p>No. Most brokers, including PL Capital, provide advanced charting tools (often powered by TradingView or ChartIQ) for free within their trading platforms. These include all essential indicators like RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages required for professional analysis.</p>
