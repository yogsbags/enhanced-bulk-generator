<h1>guide to build a personalised equity portfolio</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article provides a comprehensive <strong>step-by-step guide to build a personalised equity portfolio</strong> tailored for Indian investors in FY 2025-26. We analyze the current market context with Nifty 50 hovering around 25,800 and a PE ratio of ~22.6, suggesting a need for selective stock picking rather than blind index investing. The guide covers critical regulatory updates, including the discontinuation of Bank Nifty weekly contracts, the upcoming reduction in lot sizes (Nifty to 65, Bank Nifty to 30) effective January 2026, and the impact of the 12.5% LTCG tax regime. You will find actionable strategies for asset allocation, risk profiling, and compliance-safe execution using PL Capital&#39;s robust platforms.</p>
<p>Building a portfolio is no longer just about buying low and selling high. In the current landscape defined by SEBI&#39;s tighter norms on &quot;finfluencers&quot; and new tax structures, it requires a disciplined, data-driven approach. Whether you are a salaried professional looking to beat inflation or an HNI aiming for wealth preservation, this guide moves beyond generic tips to offer a structured framework for long-term wealth creation.</p>
<h2>Assessing Your Risk Profile: Capacity vs. Tolerance</h2>
<p>Before you buy a single share, you must distinguish between your <em>ability</em> to take risks and your <em>willingness</em> to do so. Most investors conflate the two, leading to panic selling during corrections. A <strong>step-by-step guide to build a personalised equity portfolio</strong> starts here.</p>
<h3>Risk Capacity (Financial Reality)</h3>
<p>This is a mathematical calculation of how much loss you can absorb without altering your lifestyle. It depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> A 25-year-old has more time to recover from a 20% drawdown than a 55-year-old.</li>
<li><strong>Income Stability:</strong> A government employee typically has higher risk capacity than a freelancer.</li>
<li><strong>Dependents:</strong> More financial dependents usually lower your risk capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk Tolerance (Psychological Reality)</h3>
<p>This is your emotional response to market volatility. If the Nifty drops 500 points (approx. 2%) in a day—a common occurrence in late 2025—do you lose sleep? </p>

<h2>Asset Allocation Strategy: Core and Satellite</h2>
<p>Successful investors don&#39;t bet the farm on one idea. They use the &quot;Core-Satellite&quot; approach. This strategy is central to any robust <strong>step-by-step guide to build a personalised equity portfolio</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Core (60-70% of Portfolio)</h3>
<p>This is your safety anchor. It consists of low-volatility, high-quality assets that track the broader market. In the current FY 2025-26 context, this typically involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large Cap Stocks:</strong> Companies ranked 1-100 by market capitalization (e.g., Reliance, TCS, HDFC Bank). As per SEBI definitions, these offer stability.</li>
<li><strong>Index ETFs:</strong> Nifty 50 or Nifty Next 50 ETFs. With Nifty PE at ~22.6, these offer fair valuation exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Satellite (30-40% of Portfolio)</h3>
<p>This is where you generate &quot;alpha&quot; (excess returns). These are higher-risk bets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mid &amp; Small Caps:</strong> Companies ranked 101-250 (Mid) and 251+ (Small). These can offer 15-20% growth but come with higher volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Sectoral Themes:</strong> In 2025, themes like Green Energy, Defence, and Digital Infrastructure are prominent. However, sector rotation is key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Allocation for a 35-Year-Old (Moderate-Aggressive):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50%</strong> in Nifty 50 Index / Large Cap Stocks</li>
<li><strong>20%</strong> in Nifty Midcap 150 Stocks</li>
<li><strong>10%</strong> in Emerging Sectors (e.g., EV ecosystem)</li>
<li><strong>20%</strong> in Gold/Debt (for hedging)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stock Selection Framework: Fundamental Filters</h2>
<p>With over 5,000 listed companies, how do you choose? Use this filter-based approach to shortlist quality stocks. This is the engine of your <strong>step-by-step guide to build a personalised equity portfolio</strong>.</p>
<h3>1. Return on Equity (ROE)</h3>
<p>Look for companies with <strong>ROE &gt; 15%</strong>. This indicates the management is efficiently using shareholder capital. For banking stocks, look for <strong>ROA (Return on Assets) &gt; 1%</strong>.</p>
<h3>2. Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h3>
<p>Ideally <strong>&lt; 1.0</strong>. In a high-interest-rate environment, debt-heavy companies struggle. Zero-debt companies (common in IT and FMCG) are often safer bets.</p>
<h3>3. Earnings Growth</h3>
<p>Consistent profit growth of <strong>10-15% CAGR</strong> over the last 5 years. Avoid one-hit wonders. Check the &quot;Operating Cash Flow&quot;—it should be positive and growing.</p>
<h3>4. Corporate Governance</h3>
<p>Avoid companies with frequent regulatory issues, pledged promoter shares, or opaque accounting. A quick search on SEBI&#39;s website for recent orders against the company is a good due diligence step.</p>
<p><strong>Data Source:</strong> <em>Screeners and quarterly reports. Always verify data from official exchange filings (BSE/NSE).</em> </p>
<h2>Execution &amp; Compliance: Navigating the Market</h2>
<p>Once you have your list, execution matters. The market structure in December 2025 has specific nuances you must navigate.</p>
<h3>Understanding Lot Sizes (Dec 2025 Update)</h3>
<p>If you plan to hedge your equity portfolio using derivatives, be aware of the lot sizes. As per NSE circulars, lot sizes are being revised to keep contract values near ₹15 Lakhs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nifty 50:</strong> Current lot size is <strong>75</strong>. <ul>
<li><em>Note:</em> It will reduce to <strong>65</strong> for contracts expiring after December 30, 2025.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bank Nifty:</strong> Current lot size is <strong>35</strong>.<ul>
<li><em>Note:</em> It will reduce to <strong>30</strong> for contracts expiring after December 30, 2025.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Settlement &amp; Expiry</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>T+1 Settlement:</strong> Standard for all stocks. You get shares in your demat account the next day.</li>
<li><strong>T+0 Settlement:</strong> Optional for select stocks/brokers as of late 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Expiry Days:</strong> <ul>
<li><strong>Nifty 50:</strong> Weekly contracts expire on <strong>Tuesday</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Bank Nifty:</strong> Weekly contracts were <strong>discontinued</strong> in November 2024. Only Monthly contracts exist (expiring on the last Tuesday of the month).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regulatory Caution</h3>
<p>Be wary of &quot;stock tips&quot; on social media. As per SEBI&#39;s stringent 2025 norms, unregistered &quot;finfluencers&quot; or educators must use data with a <strong>3-month lag</strong> and cannot provide real-time buy/sell recommendations. Always consult a SEBI-registered Investment Advisor (IA) or Research Analyst (RA).</p>
<h2>Tax Implications (FY 2025-26)</h2>
<p>Your returns are net of taxes. The Union Budget FY 2025-26 (effective from July 2024) significantly changed the landscape. Understanding this is crucial for your <strong>step-by-step guide to build a personalised equity portfolio</strong>.</p>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> If you make a ₹2 Lakh long-term profit, the first ₹1.25 Lakh is tax-free. You pay 12.5% on the remaining ₹75,000, which is ₹9,375.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monitoring and Rebalancing</h2>
<p>A portfolio is not a &quot;fill it, shut it, forget it&quot; engine. It requires maintenance.</p>
<h3>Quarterly Review</h3>
<p>Check if your fundamental thesis still holds. Did the company report bad numbers? Has the sector outlook changed (e.g., government policy shift in EVs)?</p>
<h3>Annual Rebalancing</h3>
<p>If your Equity allocation has grown from 50% to 70% due to a market rally (Nifty at 25,900), sell some equity and buy debt to restore the 50:50 balance. This naturally forces you to &quot;sell high and buy low.&quot;</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalize First:</strong> Your risk capacity (financial) matters more than your risk tolerance (emotional).</li>
<li><strong>Core-Satellite:</strong> Allocate 60-70% to stable Large Caps/Index funds and 30-40% to high-growth Mid/Small caps.</li>
<li><strong>Check Fundamentals:</strong> Stick to companies with ROE &gt; 15% and low debt. Avoid governance red flags.</li>
<li><strong>Know the Rules:</strong> Nifty lot is 75 (soon 65), Bank Nifty weeklies are gone, and LTCG is 12.5%.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Compliant:</strong> Ignore unregistered tips. Rely on SEBI-registered advisors and official data sources.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalance:</strong> Review your portfolio quarterly to ensure it stays aligned with your goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Month 1-2: Foundation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open a PL Capital Demat account.</li>
<li>Define your financial goals and risk profile.</li>
<li>Start SIPs in Core assets (Nifty 50 / Large Cap).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 3-4: Expansion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify 3-5 high-quality stocks for your Satellite portfolio using fundamental filters.</li>
<li>Allocate capital in tranches (don&#39;t invest lump sum at all-time highs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 5-6: Review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check portfolio performance against the benchmark (Nifty 50).</li>
<li>Rebalance if asset allocation has drifted by more than 5%.</li>
<li>Harvest tax losses if applicable (Tax Loss Harvesting) before year-end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs on Building an Equity Portfolio</h2>
<h3>What is the minimum amount needed to build a portfolio?</h3>
<p>You can start with as little as ₹500 via SIPs in ETFs or stocks. However, to build a properly diversified portfolio with individual stocks across sectors, a capital of ₹50,000 to ₹1 Lakh is recommended to cover transaction costs effectively.</p>
<h3>How does the 12.5% LTCG tax affect my returns?</h3>
<p>The LTCG rate increased to 12.5% (from 10%) in FY 2025-26. However, the exemption limit rose to ₹1.25 Lakh. For small investors, this is beneficial. For larger portfolios, it slightly reduces net returns, making tax-efficient harvesting crucial.</p>
<h3>Can I use Bank Nifty Weekly Options for hedging?</h3>
<p>No, you cannot use weekly contracts for Bank Nifty as they were discontinued in November 2024. You must use <strong>Monthly</strong> Bank Nifty options (expiring on Tuesdays) or Nifty 50 Weekly options (expiring on Tuesdays) for hedging purposes.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50?</h3>
<p>Nifty 50 represents the top 50 largest companies. Nifty Next 50 represents the next 50 (ranked 51-100). Nifty Next 50 often offers higher growth potential but comes with higher volatility compared to the stable giants in Nifty 50.</p>
<h3>How often should I churn my portfolio?</h3>
<p>Avoid frequent churning. It increases transaction costs (STT, brokerage) and tax liability (STCG 20%). Ideally, hold quality stocks for 3-5 years. Only sell if the fundamental business story changes or during your annual rebalancing exercise.</p>
