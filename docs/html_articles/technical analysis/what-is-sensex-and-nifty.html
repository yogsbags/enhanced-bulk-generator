<h1>What is Sensex and Nifty? A Complete Guide for Indian Investors (2025)</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article covers the fundamental concepts of India&#39;s two primary stock market indices: the Sensex and the Nifty 50. We examine their key differences, including composition, calculation methodologies, and sector weightages as of November 2025. The guide explains how these indices serve as barometers for the Indian economy and compares their historical returns (CAGR of ~12-15%) to help you decide which benchmark aligns better with your investment goals. You will also find actionable insights on trading these indices, including current lot sizes and expiry schedules for FY 2025-26.</p>
<p>nse and bse are the two pillars of the Indian capital markets, but for most investors, the daily &quot;market movement&quot; is defined by two numbers: the Sensex and the Nifty. Whether you are a seasoned trader tracking the Nifty&#39;s move past 26,200 or a SIP investor watching the Sensex cross 85,700, understanding these indices is non-negotiable. They don&#39;t just track stock prices; they reflect the collective mood of millions of participants and the economic health of the nation. In this guide, we break down exactly what these indices represent, how they differ, and how you can use them to build wealth in the current financial year.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Sensex and Nifty</h2>
<p>While both indices track the health of the Indian stock market, they represent different exchanges and have distinct characteristics. The <strong>Sensex</strong> (Stock Exchange Sensitive Index) is the benchmark for the <strong>BSE</strong> (Bombay Stock Exchange), while the <strong>Nifty 50</strong> is the flagship index of the <strong>NSE</strong> (National Stock Exchange).</p>
<p>For traders and investors in 2025, the differences go beyond just the number of stocks. Liquidity, derivative contract specifications, and sector exposure vary significantly. Here is a detailed comparison based on current market data.</p>

<p><em>Note: As per NSE circulars, the Nifty 50 lot size is currently 75 but will reduce to 65 for contracts expiring after December 30, 2025. Similarly, Bank Nifty lot size is 35, reducing to 30 in Jan 2026.</em></p>
<h3>Why the Difference Matters</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Diversification</strong>: Nifty 50 includes 20 more companies than Sensex, offering slightly broader exposure to sectors like metals, pharma, and auto that might be underrepresented in the 30-stock Sensex.</li>
<li><strong>Trading Liquidity</strong>: Nifty 50 derivatives (Futures &amp; Options) command significantly higher volumes than Sensex derivatives, making Nifty the preferred choice for active traders.</li>
<li><strong>Expiry Schedules</strong>: With the new &quot;One Weekly Index&quot; rule implemented by SEBI in late 2024, Nifty 50 is the <em>only</em> weekly index option available on NSE (expiring Tuesdays), while Sensex is the weekly option for BSE (expiring Thursdays). This separation helps traders manage risk without overlapping volatility.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Calculate Sensex?</h2>
<p>The Sensex is calculated using the <strong>Free-float Market Capitalization</strong> method. This methodology ensures that the index reflects the market value of shares available for trading, rather than the total outstanding shares (which would include promoter holdings).</p>
<h3>The Formula</h3>
<p><strong>Sensex = (Total Free-float Market Capitalization of 30 companies / Base Market Capitalization) × Base Index Value</strong></p>
<h3>Step-by-Step Calculation Example</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Determine Market Cap</strong>: Multiply the current share price of each of the 30 companies by their total number of shares.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Free-Float Factor</strong>: Multiply the total market cap by the &quot;free-float factor&quot; (percentage of shares available to the public). For example, if a company has a market cap of ₹5 lakh crore and 40% is public, the free-float market cap is ₹2 lakh crore.</li>
<li><strong>Sum It Up</strong>: Add the free-float market caps of all 30 companies.</li>
<li><strong>Divide by Base</strong>: Divide this sum by the &quot;Base Market Capitalization&quot; (a fixed number derived from the 1978-79 base year, adjusted for corporate actions like splits and bonuses).</li>
<li><strong>Multiply by 100</strong>: The result is multiplied by the base value of 100 to get the current Sensex level (e.g., ~85,700).</li>
</ol>
<p>This method ensures that the index moves only when real market prices change, not when companies issue new shares to promoters.</p>
<h2>What is Nifty?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Nifty 50</strong> is a diversified index comprising 50 of the largest and most liquid Indian companies listed on the NSE. It represents approximately 62% of the free-float market capitalization of the stocks listed on the NSE. Owned and managed by <strong>NSE Indices Ltd.</strong>, the Nifty is often considered a more comprehensive barometer of the Indian economy compared to the Sensex because of its wider sector coverage.</p>
<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad Representation</strong>: It covers 13 sectors of the Indian economy, including Financial Services, IT, Oil &amp; Gas, Consumer Goods, and Automobiles.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: To be included in the Nifty 50, a stock must be highly liquid, meaning it can be bought and sold easily in large quantities without impacting the price significantly.</li>
<li><strong>F&amp;O Dominance</strong>: The Nifty 50 is the most traded financial product in India. As of November 2025, it is the primary instrument for hedging portfolios against market volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Calculate Nifty?</h2>
<p>Like the Sensex, the Nifty 50 also uses the <strong>Free-float Market Capitalization</strong> method. However, its base parameters differ.</p>
<h3>The Formula</h3>
<p><strong>Nifty 50 = (Current Free-float Market Capitalization of 50 companies / Base Market Capitalization) × Base Index Value</strong></p>
<h3>Calculation Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Year</strong>: 1995</li>
<li><strong>Base Value</strong>: 1,000</li>
<li><strong>Base Capital</strong>: ₹2.06 Trillion (approximate initial capital)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Practical Example</h3>
<p>Imagine the total free-float market value of all 50 Nifty stocks today is ₹150 trillion. If the base market capital (adjusted for all corporate actions since 1995) is effectively ₹5.7 trillion, the calculation would be:</p>
<p><em>(150,000,000,000,000 / 5,700,000,000,000) × 1000 ≈ 26,315</em></p>
<p>This value changes every second during market hours (9:15 AM to 3:30 PM) as stock prices fluctuate.</p>
<h2>Companies Listed on Nifty and Sensex</h2>

<p><em>Data Source: NSE/BSE Factsheets, November 2025. Weights fluctuate daily with price changes.</em></p>
<h3>Sectoral Split</h3>
<p>Both indices are heavily skewed towards the <strong>Financial Services</strong> sector (Banks, NBFCs, Insurance), which accounts for over 35% of the weight. This means a major move in banking stocks will significantly impact both Sensex and Nifty, regardless of how other sectors like Pharma or Auto perform.</p>
<h2>Which is Better? Nifty or Sensex?</h2>
<p>The answer depends on your purpose: <strong>Trading</strong> or <strong>Investing</strong>.</p>
<h3>For Traders (F&amp;O)</h3>
<p><strong>Winner: Nifty 50</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: Nifty options have vastly superior liquidity compared to Sensex options, resulting in tighter bid-ask spreads (lower impact cost).</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Expiry</strong>: Nifty&#39;s weekly contracts (expiring Tuesdays) are the most active trading instruments in India. While Sensex has weekly expiries (Thursdays), volumes are generally lower.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong>: Most technical traders prefer Nifty charts due to the smoother price action driven by higher volumes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Long-Term Investors (Passive)</h3>
<p><strong>Winner: Tie (Slight edge to Nifty for ETFs)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Over the last 10 years, the correlation between Nifty and Sensex returns is over 99%. If Sensex goes up 1%, Nifty usually goes up ~1%.</li>
<li><strong>Product Availability</strong>: There are more Index Funds and ETFs tracking the Nifty 50 than the Sensex. This gives you more options to choose funds with lower tracking errors and expense ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Both have delivered a CAGR of approximately <strong>12-15%</strong> over the last 5-10 years (as of Nov 2025), doubling investor wealth roughly every 5-6 years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benchmarks</strong>: Sensex (30 stocks, BSE) and Nifty (50 stocks, NSE) are the primary indicators of the Indian stock market.</li>
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>: Both use free-float market capitalization, ensuring only public shares influence the index value.</li>
<li><strong>Expiry Schedule</strong>: As of Nov 2025, Nifty weekly contracts expire on <strong>Tuesdays</strong>, while Sensex weekly contracts expire on <strong>Thursdays</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Lot Sizes</strong>: Current Nifty lot is 75 (reducing to 65 in Jan 2026). Sensex lot is 20. Bank Nifty lot is 35 (reducing to 30 in Jan 2026).</li>
<li><strong>Bank Nifty Update</strong>: Weekly contracts for Bank Nifty were discontinued in Nov 2024; only monthly contracts (expiring last Tuesday) are available.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>: For long-term wealth, the difference in returns is negligible. Focus on low-cost Index Funds tracking either.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>

<h3>What is the Minimum Amount to Invest in Nifty?</h3>
<p>You can invest in Nifty via Index Mutual Funds with as little as <strong>₹100 to ₹500</strong>. If trading Nifty Futures, you need a margin of approximately <strong>₹1.2 - ₹1.5 lakh</strong> for one lot (75 units currently), depending on your broker&#39;s leverage policies.</p>
