<h2>Executive Summary</h2><div class="executive-summary">
<p>Bull put spread is a credit spread strategy that generates immediate income while expressing a moderately bullish view. You sell a higher strike put and buy a lower strike put simultaneously, collecting net premium upfront with defined maximum risk.</p>
<p>This guide covers complete implementation, income generation mechanics, risk management, and real Nifty examples. The focus is practical knowledge for consistent premium collection in range-bound to bullish markets.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy type: Credit spread, income generation</li>
<li>Capital required: ₹8,000-15,000 margin per spread typically</li>
<li>Maximum profit: Limited to net premium received</li>
<li>Maximum loss: Difference between strikes minus premium collected</li>
<li>Ideal market: Sideways to moderately bullish, low volatility</li>
<li>Nifty lot size: 75 units (subject to NSE revisions)*</li>
<li>Best used in: Stable markets with support levels holding</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Bull put spread suits traders wanting income generation with controlled risk. You collect premium immediately when entering the position. Unlike buying options where you pay premium, here you receive money upfront creating positive cash flow.</p>
<p>Most option sellers face unlimited risk when selling naked puts. Bull put spread eliminates this danger by buying protection at lower strike. Your maximum loss is predefined and manageable regardless of market crash severity.</p>
<p>Professional income traders use this in stable or rising markets. Nifty holding above support with no immediate crash expected? Bull put spread generates consistent monthly income from premium decay while market stays range-bound or trends higher.</p>
<hr>
</div><h2>Understanding Bull Put Spread Mechanics</h2>
<h3>What is Bull Put Spread</h3>
<p>Bull put spread combines two put options at different strikes. You create a credit spread receiving net premium upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell 1 put at strike A (higher strike, receive premium)</li>
<li>Buy 1 put at strike B (lower strike, pay premium)</li>
<li>Net credit = Premium received for A - Premium paid for B</li>
<li>Same expiry date for both puts</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates position with limited risk and limited reward. Maximum profit equals net premium received. Maximum loss equals strike difference minus net premium.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>
<p>Bull put spread is a vertical spread. Both puts have same expiry but different strikes. It&#39;s also a credit spread because you receive net premium upfront.</p>
<p>Strategy is moderately bullish. You profit when underlying stays flat or rises. Also profits from time decay. Best when expecting market to stay above your sold put strike.</p>
<h3>How Bull Put Spread Works</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Price Stays Above Both Strikes</strong></p>
<p>You sold 24,000 put, bought 23,800 put. Nifty expires at 24,100.</p>
<p>Both puts expire worthless. You keep entire net premium received upfront. This is maximum profit scenario. No further action needed.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Price Falls Between Strikes</strong></p>
<p>Nifty expires at 23,900 (between your strikes).</p>
<p>Your 24,000 put is ITM by 100 points. You owe 100 × 75 = ₹7,500.
Your 23,800 put expires worthless.
Loss = ₹7,500 - Net premium received.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Price Falls Below Both Strikes</strong></p>
<p>Nifty crashes to 23,500 (below both strikes).</p>
<p>Your 24,000 put is ITM by 500 points. You owe ₹37,500.
Your 23,800 put is ITM by 300 points. Worth ₹22,500.
Net loss: ₹37,500 - ₹22,500 = ₹15,000.
After premium received, loss = ₹15,000 - Premium collected.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is capped. The bought put protects against unlimited downside.</p>
<h3>Income Generation Benefit</h3>
<p><strong>Example Comparison:</strong></p>
<p>Current Nifty: 24,000
Strategy: Bullish/neutral view for 2 weeks
India VIX: 15.5</p>
<p><strong>Option A: Sell 24,000 put naked</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Premium received: ₹180 × 75 = ₹13,500</li>
<li>Margin required: ~₹80,000-₹1,00,000</li>
<li>Risk: Unlimited if market crashes</li>
<li>Profit: ₹13,500 if Nifty above 24,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: Bull put spread (Sell 24,000, Buy 23,800)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell 24,000 put: Receive ₹180 × 75 = ₹13,500</li>
<li>Buy 23,800 put: Pay ₹90 × 75 = ₹6,750</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹13,500 - ₹6,750 = ₹6,750</li>
<li>Margin required: ~₹12,000-₹15,000</li>
<li>Maximum risk: (200 × 75) - 6,750 = ₹8,250</li>
<li>Profit: ₹6,750 if Nifty above 24,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Bull put spread reduces margin by 80-85% versus naked put. Risk is defined and manageable. Return on margin can be 40-60% if spread expires worthless.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Market Analysis</h3>
<p>Check current trend and support levels. Bull put spread needs stable or bullish conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price above 50-day moving average</li>
<li>Recent higher lows intact</li>
<li>Strong support level nearby</li>
<li>No bearish divergence on RSI</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Volatility Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>India VIX between 12-18 is optimal. Higher VIX means you collect more premium but also higher risk. Lower VIX provides smaller income but safer environment.</p>
<p><strong>Support Identification:</strong></p>
<p>Mark recent swing lows, psychological levels (24,000, 23,500), and moving averages. Your sold put should be at or below strong support.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Strike Selection</h3>
<p><strong>Higher Strike (Sell):</strong> Choose ATM or slightly OTM strike.</p>
<p>If Nifty is 24,000, sell 24,000 put (ATM) or 23,950 put (OTM). ATM collects more premium but higher risk. OTM provides safety buffer.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Strike (Buy):</strong> Choose 100-200 points below sold strike.</p>
<p>For 24,000 sell, buy 23,800 or 23,850 put. Wider spread means more risk and more premium kept. Narrower spread is safer but collects less.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Selection Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell put at or below current support level</li>
<li>Keep spread width 100-300 points for Nifty</li>
<li>Aim for credit of 30-40% of spread width</li>
<li>Check both strikes have good liquidity (OI 50,000+)</li>
<li>Ensure reward-risk ratio minimum 1:2 (risk ₹1 to make ₹0.50+)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Expiry Selection</h3>
<p>Choose expiry based on income frequency and time decay preference.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Expiry (Tuesday)*:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quick income generation (7-10 days)</li>
<li>Higher theta decay rate</li>
<li>Lower total premium but frequent opportunities</li>
<li>Requires active management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly Expiry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Larger premium collection per trade</li>
<li>More time cushion for market fluctuations</li>
<li>Fewer trades but higher income per trade</li>
<li>Suitable for less active traders</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter with 7-15 days to expiry for optimal theta decay. Avoid entering with more than 30 days (slow decay) or less than 5 days (excessive gamma risk).</p>
<h3>Step 4: Execute the Trade</h3>
<p>Place both orders simultaneously as a spread order for best execution.</p>
<p><strong>Execution Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select &quot;Strategies&quot; or &quot;Spread&quot; in trading platform</li>
<li>Choose &quot;Bull Put Spread&quot; or &quot;Credit Spread&quot; template</li>
<li>Enter sell strike (higher) and buy strike (lower)</li>
<li>Set limit price for net credit (minimum acceptable)</li>
<li>Review margin requirement</li>
<li>Place order</li>
</ol>
<p>If platform doesn&#39;t support spreads, leg into position:</p>
<ul>
<li>First: Sell the higher strike put</li>
<li>Second: Buy the lower strike put immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>Never leg in slowly. Execute both within seconds to avoid market movement risk.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Position Management</h3>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Take Profit Early</strong></p>
<p>When spread loses 50-60% of value, close for profit. Don&#39;t wait for full expiry. Example: Collected ₹6,750 credit, close when buy-back cost is ₹2,700-₹3,375.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Defend at 2X Loss</strong></p>
<p>If spread value reaches 2× initial credit (loss = initial credit), consider closing. Example: Collected ₹6,750, close if spread cost rises to ₹13,500.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Roll When Tested</strong></p>
<p>Market approaching your sold strike with 5+ days remaining? Roll down to lower strikes collecting additional credit. This extends duration and improves breakeven.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Exit Before Expiry</strong></p>
<p>Close position 1-2 days before expiry even at small loss. Expiry day pin risk and assignment complications outweigh small additional theta.</p>

<h2>Risk and Reward Analysis</h2>
<h3>Maximum Profit Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Net Premium Received</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sold 24,000 put at ₹180</li>
<li>Bought 23,800 put at ₹90</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹90 per contract</li>
<li>For 1 lot (75 units): ₹90 × 75 = ₹6,750</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum profit = ₹6,750</p>
<p>This occurs when Nifty stays above 24,000 at expiry. Both puts expire worthless. You keep entire premium. No further action needed.</p>
<p><strong>Example Return:</strong> ₹6,750 profit on ₹12,000 margin = 56% return if successful (2 weeks)</p>
<h3>Maximum Loss Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Strike A - Strike B) - Net Premium Received</p>
<p>Maximum loss = (24,000 - 23,800) - 90 = ₹110 per contract
For 1 lot: ₹110 × 75 = ₹8,250</p>
<p>This occurs when Nifty falls below 23,800 at expiry. Both puts are ITM. Spread reaches maximum width. Your protection kick in, limiting further loss.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward Ratio:</strong> Risk ₹8,250 to make ₹6,750 = 1.22:1 ratio. You risk ₹1.22 for every ₹1 profit potential.</p>
<h3>Breakeven Point</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Sold Strike - Net Premium Received</p>
<p>Breakeven = 24,000 - 90 = 23,910</p>
<p>Nifty needs to stay above 23,910 for profit. Between 23,910-24,000, you make partial profit. Above 24,000, you keep full premium.</p>
<h3>Probability Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Edge:</strong></p>
<p>If sold strike is 2% below current price (Nifty 24,000, sold 24,000 put), historical data shows Nifty stays above that level 70-75% of time in neutral to bullish conditions.</p>
<p>Your profit probability improves when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong support exists at sold strike</li>
<li>Market in clear uptrend</li>
<li>VIX declining (falling volatility)</li>
<li>Time decay working in your favor</li>
</ul>
<p>The 70-75% success rate on well-selected spreads makes this viable income strategy when repeated consistently over time.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to Use Bull Put Spread</h2>
<h3>Ideal Market Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Range-Bound Markets:</strong></p>
<p>Nifty trading in 500-point range for weeks. Clear support and resistance. Perfect for selling puts at support level. Collect premium as market chops sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Uptrends:</strong></p>
<p>Price making higher lows, steady advance. Not overextended. Bull put spreads below current support collect premium while giving market room to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Correction Bounce:</strong></p>
<p>Market corrected 3-5% to strong support. Bounce initiated. Oversold indicators recovering. Sell puts at correction low to collect premium on recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Low Volatility Environments:</strong></p>
<p>VIX between 12-16. Calm markets with low daily ranges. Premium decay accelerates. Multiple spreads can be sold per month for consistent income.</p>
<h3>Avoid This Strategy When</h3>
<p><strong>Downtrends:</strong></p>
<p>Clear lower highs and lower lows. Selling puts into downtrend fights the tape. High failure rate. Wait for trend reversal confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Volatility:</strong></p>
<p>VIX above 22-25. Wild daily swings. Even OTM spreads get tested frequently. Premium is high but risk is excessive. Better to wait for volatility calm.</p>
<p><strong>Near Major Resistance:</strong></p>
<p>Nifty at all-time highs or major resistance. Limited upside, significant downside if rejection occurs. Not ideal time for bullish strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Before High-Impact Events:</strong></p>
<p>RBI policy, budget, major global events within 2-3 days. Spreads can gap through your strikes. Wait until after event and volatility settles.</p>
<h3>Best Entry Timing</h3>
<p><strong>Monday Morning:</strong></p>
<p>Fresh week beginning. If market strong on Friday close and gaps up Monday, sell puts below support. Week-long theta decay ahead.</p>
<p><strong>After Support Test:</strong></p>
<p>Price dipped to test support, bounced with volume. Support confirmed. Sell puts at tested level with high confidence.</p>
<p><strong>VIX Spikes Then Falls:</strong></p>
<p>VIX spikes to 20+ on short-term fear, then drops back. Elevated premiums available as fear subsides. Good entry for premium collection.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-Week in Stable Markets:</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday-Thursday in calm markets. Sell 7-10 day spreads capturing remaining time decay. Lower risk than Monday entries near events.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Understanding Risk Factors</h2>
<h3>Price Movement (Delta)</h3>
<p>Bull put spread has negative delta overall. Position loses if market falls, gains if market rises or stays flat.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty rises 100 points, spread loses value (good for you). You can close early for profit. If Nifty falls toward your sold strike, spread gains value (bad - potential loss).</p>
<p>Your short put has delta around -0.40, long put around -0.25. Net delta approximately -0.15. For 100-point Nifty drop, spread loses ~₹1,125 in value.</p>
<h3>Time Decay (Theta)</h3>
<p>Time works FOR you in bull put spreads. This is the primary profit driver.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Net credit collected: ₹6,750</li>
<li>10 days to expiry</li>
<li>Daily theta gain: ₹500-700 per day initially</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day, spread loses value automatically if market stays flat. You profit from time decay. This accelerates in final 7-10 days before expiry.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Period:</strong> Last 5 days before expiry, theta is maximum. Also highest gamma risk. Best to exit 2-3 days early capturing 80% of profit with much lower risk.</p>
<h3>Volatility Impact (Vega)</h3>
<p>Volatility decrease benefits credit spreads. If VIX falls, option premiums compress, spread value drops (your profit).</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<p>Enter spreads when VIX is slightly elevated (16-18). As VIX normalizes to 13-14, premiums decay faster. You profit from both time decay AND volatility crush.</p>
<p>Avoid entering when VIX already at lows (11-12). No volatility compression benefit. Wait for small VIX spike then sell spreads on the decline.</p>

<h2>Real Nifty Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Successful Premium Collection</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 5, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,280</li>
<li>View: Neutral to bullish, support at 24,000</li>
<li>India VIX: 16.8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sold 24,000 put at ₹165 (₹12,375 for 75 lot)</li>
<li>Bought 23,800 put at ₹85 (₹6,375 for 75 lot)</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹80 × 75 = ₹6,000</li>
<li>Expiry: November 19, 2025 (Tuesday)</li>
<li>Margin blocked: ~₹12,500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum profit: ₹6,000 (if Nifty above 24,000)</li>
<li>Maximum loss: (200 × 75) - 6,000 = ₹9,000</li>
<li>Breakeven: 23,920</li>
<li>Return on margin: 48% if successful</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result on November 18:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty closes at 24,350</li>
<li>Both puts far OTM</li>
<li>Spread value: ₹500 (nearly worthless)</li>
<li>Exit spread at ₹500 cost</li>
<li>Profit: ₹6,000 - ₹500 = ₹5,500</li>
<li>Return: 44% in 13 days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exit Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Closed day before expiry at 92% of maximum profit. Avoided expiry day gamma risk. Captured majority of time decay safely.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Loss Management Example</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 8, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,180</li>
<li>View: Market at support, expecting bounce</li>
<li>India VIX: 14.2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sold 24,100 put at ₹170 (₹12,750)</li>
<li>Bought 23,900 put at ₹95 (₹7,125)</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹75 × 75 = ₹5,625</li>
<li>Expiry: November 19, 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Went Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>Unexpected negative global news. Market broke support. Nifty fell to 23,800 by November 12.</p>
<p><strong>Exit on November 12:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty at 23,850</li>
<li>Spread intrinsic value: (24,100 - 23,850) = 250 points</li>
<li>Spread cost to close: ₹18,750 + time value</li>
<li>Total exit cost: ₹20,000</li>
<li>Loss: ₹20,000 - ₹5,625 = ₹14,375</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Didn&#39;t wait for maximum loss. Exited when technical breakdown confirmed. Saved ₹3,000 versus holding till expiry (max loss ₹9,375 would become actual loss).</p>
<p>Could have rolled down to 23,700/23,500 spread collecting additional credit, but chose to cut loss and reset. Conservative approach preserved capital for next trade.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Selling Naked Puts</strong></p>
<p>Selling puts without buying protection. Unlimited risk. One market crash wipes out months of profits. Always buy lower strike for protection.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Too Narrow Spreads</strong></p>
<p>Using 50-point spreads. Commission costs and slippage eat profits. Minimum 100-point spreads for Nifty, preferably 150-200 points.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Chasing Premium</strong></p>
<p>Selling far ITM puts for huge premium. High probability of assignment. Risk massively exceeds reward. Stick to ATM or OTM strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Ignoring Support Levels</strong></p>
<p>Selling puts at random strikes. No technical basis. Always sell at or below identified support. This dramatically improves success rate.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: Over-Leveraging</strong></p>
<p>Selling 10 spreads because margin is available. One bad move blows up account. Limit to 2-3 spreads maximum per cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 6: Holding Through Expiry</strong></p>
<p>Trying to squeeze last ₹500 of profit. Expiry day gamma and pin risk can turn winner into loser. Exit 1-2 days early always.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 7: No Adjustment Plan</strong></p>
<p>Market tests your strike, you freeze. Need pre-defined plan: roll down, exit at 2X loss, or close when 50% profit achieved.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Bull put spread generates immediate income from net premium collected upfront while expressing moderately bullish or neutral market view.</p>
<p>Strategy provides 40-60% return on margin for successful spreads expiring worthless. Requires 70-75% win rate to be profitable long-term.</p>
<p>Maximum risk is defined and limited to spread width minus premium collected. Much safer than naked put selling with unlimited risk.</p>
<p>Time decay and volatility compression are primary profit drivers. Enter when VIX slightly elevated, exit when spread loses 50-60% of value.</p>
<p>Strike selection is critical. Sell puts at or below strong support levels with technical confirmation. This improves probability of success dramatically.</p>
<p>Active management required. Don&#39;t set and forget. Monitor daily, take early profits, cut losses at 2X credit, roll when tested.</p>
<p>Works best in stable to moderately bullish markets with low to medium volatility. Avoid during downtrends, high volatility, or before major events.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1-2: Market Study</strong></p>
<p>Identify Nifty support levels over past 3 months. Note where bounces occurred. Study VIX patterns around those levels. Track premium levels at different volatility environments. Build reference database of spreads you could have sold.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3-4: Paper Trading</strong></p>
<p>Execute 5 bull put spreads on paper. Track daily P&amp;L, theta decay, and delta changes. Practice closing at 50% profit rule. Experience how spreads behave near expiry. Learn without risking capital.</p>
<p><strong>Month 2: Small Live Trades</strong></p>
<p>Start with single 100-point spread risking maximum ₹7,500-8,000. Sell at obvious support level only. Exit at 50% profit or 2X loss strictly. Build confidence through discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3: Frequency Building</strong></p>
<p>Attempt 2 spreads per month. Different expirations for diversification. One weekly, one monthly. Compare decay rates and profitability. Find your preferred timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Month 4: Income Consistency</strong></p>
<p>Scale to 2 concurrent spreads maximum. Never more than 5% of capital at risk total. Track monthly income generated. Adjust strikes based on volatility levels. Aim for 3-4 winners out of 5 attempts.</p>
<p>Review quarterly: Calculate total premium collected, total losses taken, net income, and return on capital employed. Successful traders show 65-70% win rate with profit/loss ratio of 1:1.5.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bull put spread delivers consistent income generation through premium collection with clearly defined and manageable risk. The credit nature of strategy provides immediate cash inflow attractive to income-focused traders.</p>
<p>Strategy excels in stable to moderately bullish markets with controlled volatility. Time decay and support levels work in your favor creating high-probability setups when properly selected.</p>
<p>Success requires discipline in strike selection, position sizing, and risk management. Early profit-taking and loss-cutting discipline matter more than perfect market timing.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q1: What is bull put spread strategy in Nifty options?</strong></p>
<p>Bull put spread involves selling a higher strike put and buying a lower strike put simultaneously. You collect net premium upfront (credit spread). Maximum profit is limited to credit received. Maximum loss is limited to spread width minus credit. Strategy profits when Nifty stays above sold strike. Best for neutral to bullish markets.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: How much margin is required for bull put spread in Nifty?</strong></p>
<p>Margin typically ₹8,000-15,000 per 100-200 point spread. Much lower than naked put selling which requires ₹80,000-1,00,000. Exact margin varies by broker and strike selection. SPAN margin applies for spread traders. Credit received reduces net margin requirement slightly.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: When should I use bull put spread versus bull call spread?</strong></p>
<p>Bull put spread is credit strategy - you receive money upfront. Better for income generation in sideways to slightly bullish markets. Bull call spread is debit strategy - you pay upfront. Better for strong directional bullish moves. Use put spread when expecting market to stay flat or rise moderately.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: What is good return on bull put spread trades?</strong></p>
<p>Target 30-50% return on margin for successful trades. If you collect ₹6,000 credit on ₹12,000 margin, that&#39;s 50% return if spread expires worthless (typically 1-2 weeks). With 70% win rate, average 20-30% monthly return on deployed capital is achievable for consistent traders.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: How do I manage bull put spread if market falls to my strike?</strong></p>
<p>Three options: (1) Roll down to lower strikes collecting additional credit and extending time, (2) Exit at 2X initial credit to limit loss, (3) Hold if strong support and expiry far enough. Never let spread reach maximum loss. Exit or adjust when still have time value remaining.</p>
<hr>
<div class="important-notes">**Important Notes:**

<p>*Lot sizes subject to NSE revisions. Weekly expiry on Tuesday per current NSE schedule (subject to change). Margin requirements vary by broker and SEBI regulations. Bull put spread involves risk of total loss of credit received plus spread width. Win rates vary significantly based on market conditions, strike selection, and trader discipline. This guide is educational only. Options trading involves substantial risk. Consult SEBI-registered advisor before implementing credit spread strategies. Past performance examples don&#39;t guarantee future results. Practice extensively with paper trading before risking real capital.</p>

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Bull put spread is credit strategy - you receive money upfront. Better for income generation in sideways to slightly bullish markets. Bull call spread is debit strategy - you pay upfront. Better for strong directional bullish moves. Use put spread when expecting market to stay flat or rise moderately."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Target 30-50% return on margin for successful trades. If you collect ₹6,000 credit on ₹12,000 margin, that's 50% return if spread expires worthless (typically 1-2 weeks). With 70% win rate, average 20-30% monthly return on deployed capital is achievable for consistent traders."

        "text": "Three options: (1) Roll down to lower strikes collecting additional credit and extending time, (2) Exit at 2X initial credit to limit loss, (3) Hold if strong support and expiry far enough. Never let spread reach maximum loss. Exit or adjust when still have time value remaining."
