<h1>Straddle Strategy on Nifty: Volatility Trading Guide for India</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2025 | <strong>Reading Time:</strong> 11 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2><div class="executive-summary">
<p>Straddle is a non-directional options strategy where you buy both call and put at the same strike price simultaneously. This profits from large price movements in either direction, regardless of which way market moves.</p>
<p>This guide covers complete implementation, breakeven calculations, volatility analysis, and real Nifty examples. The focus is practical knowledge for traders seeking to profit from market volatility without predicting direction.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy type: Non-directional, unlimited profit potential</li>
<li>Capital required: ₹15,000-25,000 per straddle typically</li>
<li>Maximum loss: Limited to total premium paid</li>
<li>Maximum profit: Unlimited in either direction</li>
<li>Ideal market: Low volatility before major events</li>
<li>Nifty lot size: 75 units (subject to NSE revisions)*</li>
<li>Best used in: Pre-event periods with expected volatility expansion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Straddle suits traders expecting significant price movement without knowing direction. You buy ATM call and ATM put simultaneously. Both expire same date. If market moves sharply either way, one leg gains more than both legs cost. Net result is profit from volatility.</p>
<p>Most traders try predicting market direction and fail frequently. Straddle eliminates this guesswork. You profit from movement itself. Market crashes 5%? Put gains cover everything. Market rallies 5%? Call gains cover everything. Direction doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>Professional traders deploy straddles before events with uncertain outcomes. RBI policy decisions, budget announcements, election results. Market will move sharply but direction unknown. Straddle captures that movement profitably.</p>
<hr>
</div><h2>Understanding Straddle Mechanics</h2>
<h3>What is Straddle</h3>
<p>Straddle combines ATM call and ATM put with identical strikes and expiry. You pay premium for both, creating debit position.</p>
<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 1 ATM call option</li>
<li>Buy 1 ATM put option (same strike)</li>
<li>Pay premium for both upfront</li>
<li>Same expiry date for both options</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates position with limited risk but unlimited profit potential. Maximum loss equals total premium paid. Maximum gain is theoretically unlimited as market can move infinitely either direction.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>
<p>Straddle is volatility strategy, not directional strategy. You&#39;re buying volatility itself. Market movement in any direction creates profit potential. Works best when volatility is mispriced or about to expand.</p>
<p>The strategy is market-neutral at initiation. Equal exposure to upside and downside. You profit when actual movement exceeds implied volatility priced into options.</p>
<h3>How Straddle Works</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Sharp Upside Move</strong></p>
<p>You bought 24,000 call and 24,000 put. Nifty rallies to 24,400.</p>
<p>Your 24,000 call gains: (24,400 - 24,000) × 75 = ₹30,000.
Your 24,000 put expires worthless, loses premium paid.
Net profit = Call gain - Total premium paid.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Sharp Downside Move</strong></p>
<p>Nifty crashes to 23,600 (same 400-point move).</p>
<p>Your 24,000 put gains: (24,000 - 23,600) × 75 = ₹30,000.
Your 24,000 call expires worthless, loses premium paid.
Net profit = Put gain - Total premium paid.</p>
<p>Notice identical profit from either direction. This is straddle&#39;s power.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: No Significant Move</strong></p>
<p>Nifty expires at 24,050 (minimal movement).</p>
<p>Your 24,000 call barely ITM: 50 × 75 = ₹3,750.
Your 24,000 put expires worthless.
Total premium paid was ₹18,000.
Net loss = ₹18,000 - ₹3,750 = ₹14,250.</p>
<p>This is maximum loss scenario. Market stays near ATM strike. Both options lose most value to time decay.</p>
<h3>Volatility Profit Mechanism</h3>
<p><strong>Example Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Current Nifty: 24,000
India VIX: 12 (low volatility)</p>
<p><strong>Straddle Purchase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 24,000 call at ₹140 (₹10,500 for 75 lot)</li>
<li>Buy 24,000 put at ₹110 (₹8,250 for 75 lot)</li>
<li>Total cost: ₹18,750</li>
<li>Days to expiry: 7</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Required Movement:</strong></p>
<p>Breakeven points: 23,750 and 24,250 (250 points either side)
That&#39;s 1% move needed for zero profit/loss.</p>
<p>If Nifty moves 3% (720 points) to 24,720:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call value: ₹720 × 75 = ₹54,000</li>
<li>Put value: ₹0</li>
<li>Profit: ₹54,000 - ₹18,750 = ₹35,250</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Low VIX means cheap straddles. Events can trigger 2-4% moves easily. This creates profitable opportunity when volatility is underpriced.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Identify Volatility Opportunity</h3>
<p>Straddle works when volatility is about to expand significantly. Check current environment.</p>
<p><strong>Low Volatility Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India VIX below 14-15</li>
<li>Options trading at cheap premiums</li>
<li>Market consolidating in tight range</li>
<li>Implied volatility below historical average</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Event Catalyst Ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RBI monetary policy in 2-3 days</li>
<li>Union budget announcement</li>
<li>Major election results</li>
<li>Global central bank decisions</li>
<li>Earnings season for key stocks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price compressed in narrow range</li>
<li>Bollinger Bands squeezing tight</li>
<li>ATR declining to multi-week lows</li>
<li>Volume declining during compression</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Strike Selection</h3>
<p>Choose ATM strike for maximum symmetry and leverage.</p>
<p><strong>ATM Strike (Recommended):</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty is 24,050, buy 24,000 or 24,050 strike for both call and put. ATM options have highest gamma, respond fastest to price changes.</p>
<p><strong>Slightly OTM Alternative:</strong></p>
<p>For lower cost, buy 24,100 call and 23,900 put (creating strangle). Requires bigger move but costs less. More advanced variation.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Selection Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always use same strike for call and put in pure straddle</li>
<li>Choose nearest ATM strike to current price</li>
<li>Check open interest above 1 lakh contracts</li>
<li>Verify bid-ask spread under 2-3 points</li>
<li>Ensure sufficient liquidity for exit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Expiry Selection</h3>
<p>Choose expiry matching your event timeline and risk tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>Short-Term (Weekly Expiry)*:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For specific events (RBI policy on Tuesday)</li>
<li>Lower cost but faster time decay</li>
<li>Need event within 3-5 days</li>
<li>Higher leverage potential</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medium-Term (Monthly Expiry):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For uncertain event timing</li>
<li>Higher cost but more time cushion</li>
<li>Absorbs false breakouts better</li>
<li>Suitable for multi-week volatility trades</li>
</ul>
<p>Most event-based straddles use nearest expiry after the event. Buy straddle 2-4 days before event. Exit immediately after volatility expansion occurs.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Execute the Straddle</h3>
<p>Buy both legs simultaneously at market open or during stable periods.</p>
<p><strong>Execution Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select ATM strike (e.g., 24,000)</li>
<li>Buy 1 lot call option at market price</li>
<li>Buy 1 lot put option at market price (immediately)</li>
<li>Verify both positions filled</li>
<li>Note total premium paid</li>
<li>Set alerts for breakeven points</li>
</ol>
<p>Execute both legs within seconds. Avoid legging in over hours. Market can move against you between orders. Simultaneous execution ensures proper hedge.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Position Management</h3>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Exit After Event</strong></p>
<p>Once event passes and volatility expands, take profit. Don&#39;t wait for maximum theoretical gain. Realized profit beats hoped-for profit.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Cut Loss on Volatility Crush</strong></p>
<p>If VIX drops instead of rising, exit position. Continuing time decay without volatility expansion kills straddles. Cut loss at 30-40% of premium.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Time-Based Exit</strong></p>
<p>If event doesn&#39;t materialize or postponed, exit before final 3 days. Time decay accelerates exponentially. Don&#39;t let theta eat entire premium.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Take Partial Profits</strong></p>
<p>If one leg gains 100%+ while other has time left, book partial profit. Reduce position size. Lock gains. Let remainder run with house money.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Breakeven and Profit Analysis</h2>
<h3>Breakeven Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> ATM Strike ± Total Premium Paid</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strike: 24,000</li>
<li>Call premium: ₹140 × 75 = ₹10,500</li>
<li>Put premium: ₹110 × 75 = ₹8,250</li>
<li>Total premium: ₹18,750</li>
<li>Per-unit premium: ₹250</li>
</ul>
<p>Upper breakeven = 24,000 + 250 = 24,250
Lower breakeven = 24,000 - 250 = 23,750</p>
<p>Nifty needs to move beyond these points for profit. Within this range, you lose money due to premium paid.</p>
<h3>Maximum Loss Scenario</h3>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Total Premium Paid</p>
<p>Maximum loss = ₹18,750</p>
<p>This occurs when Nifty expires exactly at 24,000 (ATM strike). Both options expire worthless. You lose entire premium paid. This is predefined and capped.</p>
<h3>Profit Potential</h3>
<p><strong>Unlimited in Both Directions:</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty moves to 24,500:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call profit: (500 - 250) × 75 = ₹18,750</li>
<li>Put loss: Premium paid</li>
<li>Net: Breakeven at +500 points, profit beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>If Nifty moves to 25,000:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call profit: (1,000 - 250) × 75 = ₹56,250</li>
<li>Put loss: ₹8,250</li>
<li>Net profit: ₹56,250 - ₹18,750 = ₹37,500</li>
</ul>
<p>The further market moves, the more you profit. No cap on maximum gain.</p>
<h3>Risk-Reward Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Probability Consideration:</strong></p>
<p>Straddles require significant movement to profit. Your breakeven is ~1% move either side. Markets exceed this during events but not in normal periods.</p>
<p>Your profit chances improve when:</p>
<ul>
<li>VIX is historically low (cheap volatility)</li>
<li>Major catalyst approaching (event certainty)</li>
<li>Technical compression visible (tight ranges)</li>
<li>Time to expiry matches event timing (2-5 days ideal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Without catalyst, time decay works against you daily. Choose entry timing carefully.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to Use Straddle</h2>
<h3>Ideal Market Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Pre-Event Volatility Suppression:</strong></p>
<p>VIX dropping before major event. Market waiting for clarity. Tight range consolidation. Perfect setup as volatility typically explodes post-event.</p>
<p><strong>Earnings Season:</strong></p>
<p>Key index heavyweights reporting earnings. Results uncertain. Market expecting significant move. Straddle captures whipsaw movements.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Announcements:</strong></p>
<p>RBI monetary policy meetings. Budget presentations. Regulatory changes expected. Direction unknown but movement guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Compression:</strong></p>
<p>Bollinger Bands tightest in 3+ months. ATR at multi-week lows. Volume declining. Compression precedes expansion typically.</p>
<h3>Avoid This Strategy When</h3>
<p><strong>High Volatility Environment:</strong></p>
<p>VIX already elevated above 20. Premiums expensive. Straddle costs too much. Would need excessive movement for profit.</p>
<p><strong>No Catalyst Visible:</strong></p>
<p>Buying straddle randomly without event or setup. Time decay kills position systematically. Avoid speculative straddles without reason.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Event Period:</strong></p>
<p>Volatility already expanded. Event passed. VIX declining. Straddles become expensive and unprofitable. Timing matters critically.</p>
<h3>Best Entry Timing</h3>
<p><strong>2-3 Days Before Event:</strong></p>
<p>Close enough for manageable time decay. Far enough for cheap premiums. Optimal timing for most event-based straddles.</p>
<p><strong>During Range Compression:</strong></p>
<p>When technical setup shows extreme tightness. Even without specific event, compression often precedes expansion.</p>
<p><strong>VIX at Multi-Month Lows:</strong></p>
<p>Historical analysis shows VIX mean-reverts. Extreme lows precede spikes. Buy volatility when it&#39;s historically cheap.</p>
<p><strong>Opening Hour After Flat Gap:</strong></p>
<p>Market opens flat after overnight calm. Consolidation continues. Deploy straddle expecting eventual breakout either direction.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Understanding Risk Factors</h2>
<h3>Time Decay (Theta)</h3>
<p>Time decay is straddle&#39;s biggest enemy. Both call and put lose value daily.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong></p>
<p>With 7 days to expiry, your straddle might lose ₹2,000-3,000 daily to theta. That&#39;s ₹14,000-21,000 per week if market stays flat. You&#39;re fighting time constantly.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Period:</strong> Last 5 days accelerate decay dramatically. Your straddle can lose 50% value in final 3 days without movement. Always exit before this period.</p>
<h3>Volatility Changes (Vega)</h3>
<p>Volatility expansion is straddle&#39;s friend. Volatility crush is straddle&#39;s enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<p>If VIX jumps from 12 to 18 after event, your straddle gains value even without price movement. Both call and put benefit from higher implied volatility.</p>
<p>Conversely, if VIX drops from 15 to 11, your straddle loses value immediately. This is volatility crush. Can happen post-event if result is neutral.</p>
<p>Enter when VIX is low. Exit when VIX spikes. This timing is crucial.</p>
<h3>Price Movement (Delta and Gamma)</h3>
<p>Straddle starts delta-neutral. As price moves, delta shifts toward movement direction.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong></p>
<p>If Nifty rises 100 points, call gains delta, put loses delta. Net position becomes bullish. Further upside accelerates gains due to gamma effect.</p>
<p>Gamma is your friend in straddles. It accelerates gains when movement starts. But it also means you need significant initial movement to overcome premium cost.</p>

<h2>Real Nifty Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Successful RBI Policy Straddle</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 4, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,100</li>
<li>RBI policy on November 6</li>
<li>India VIX: 13.2 (low)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,100 call at ₹155 (₹11,625)</li>
<li>Bought 24,100 put at ₹130 (₹9,750)</li>
<li>Total cost: ₹285 × 75 = ₹21,375</li>
<li>Expiry: November 12 (weekly)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Breakeven points: 23,815 and 24,385</li>
<li>Maximum loss: ₹21,375</li>
<li>Days to expiry: 8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result After RBI Policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RBI unexpectedly hiked rates</li>
<li>Nifty crashed to 23,600 in 1 day</li>
<li>VIX spiked to 18.5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exit on November 7:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put value: (24,100 - 23,600) × 75 = ₹37,500</li>
<li>Call value: Nearly worthless</li>
<li>Profit: ₹37,500 - ₹21,375 = ₹16,125</li>
<li>Return: 75% in 3 days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Learning:</strong></p>
<p>Perfect execution. Low VIX entry. Clear catalyst. Swift exit after volatility expansion. Captured 500-point move profitably.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Budget Announcement Straddle</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: January 20, 2026</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,650</li>
<li>Budget on January 23</li>
<li>India VIX: 14.8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,650 call at ₹170 (₹12,750)</li>
<li>Bought 24,650 put at ₹160 (₹12,000)</li>
<li>Total cost: ₹330 × 75 = ₹24,750</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result After Budget:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Budget announcements mostly neutral</li>
<li>Market moved to 24,850 (only 200 points)</li>
<li>VIX dropped to 12.5 (volatility crush)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exit on January 24:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call value: (24,850 - 24,650) × 75 = ₹15,000</li>
<li>Put value: Negligible</li>
<li>Total recovery: ₹15,000</li>
<li>Loss: ₹24,750 - ₹15,000 = ₹9,750</li>
<li>Loss: 39%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Not every event creates big moves. Neutral outcome caused volatility crush. Lost 39% despite being directionally correct on small move. This demonstrates straddle&#39;s key risk.</p>
<h3>Example 3: Maximum Loss Scenario</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Date: November 15, 2025</li>
<li>Nifty spot: 24,300</li>
<li>No specific event, technical compression</li>
<li>Bought straddle speculatively</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 24,300 call at ₹145 (₹10,875)</li>
<li>Bought 24,300 put at ₹140 (₹10,500)</li>
<li>Total cost: ₹285 × 75 = ₹21,375</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No catalyst materialized</li>
<li>Market stayed range-bound</li>
<li>Nifty expired at 24,280</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result on Expiry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both options expired near worthless</li>
<li>Recovered ₹1,500 approximately</li>
<li>Loss: ₹21,375 - ₹1,500 = ₹19,875</li>
<li>Loss: 93%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Never buy straddles without clear catalyst. Time decay killed position systematically. Lost almost entire premium in 15 days. This shows why timing and setup matter critically.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Buying Expensive Straddles</strong></p>
<p>Entering when VIX is already high (18+). Premiums are expensive. Movement required for profit becomes unrealistic.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: No Exit Plan</strong></p>
<p>Hoping for maximum profit. Watching one leg gain 100% then give it back. Take profits when volatility expands. Don&#39;t get greedy.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Wrong Expiry Selection</strong></p>
<p>Using monthly expiry for 2-day event. Paying excessive time premium. Or using weekly for uncertain timing. Match expiry to catalyst.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Holding Through Expiry</strong></p>
<p>Waiting till last day hoping for miracle move. Last 3 days accelerate theta decay exponentially. Exit earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: Legging In Separately</strong></p>
<p>Buying call first, waiting hours, then buying put. Market moves against you. Always execute simultaneously within seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 6: Random Straddle Without Setup</strong></p>
<p>Buying straddles regularly without catalyst or technical compression. Time decay wins systematically. Need specific reason.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 7: Over-Sizing Position</strong></p>
<p>Risking 30-40% of capital on single straddle. When it fails (and some will), portfolio damage is severe. Keep position size under 10% of capital.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Straddle profits from significant price movements in either direction without needing to predict which way market moves.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is limited to total premium paid upfront which provides complete risk clarity before entering the position.</p>
<p>Strategy works best when volatility is low but major catalyst approaching that will likely trigger significant market movement.</p>
<p>Breakeven requires movement beyond total premium paid in either direction typically 1-2% for Nifty straddles.</p>
<p>Time decay works aggressively against straddles requiring quick decisive moves to overcome theta erosion of both options.</p>
<p>Entry timing is critical: buy when VIX is low and clear catalyst exists within 2-5 days of expiry.</p>
<p>Exit discipline matters more than entry: take profits when volatility expands rather than waiting for maximum theoretical gains.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1-2: Study Historical Events</strong></p>
<p>Review past 20 RBI policies, budgets, election results. Note Nifty movement magnitude. Check VIX levels before and after. Understand typical volatility expansion patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3-4: Paper Trade Events</strong></p>
<p>Paper trade 3-4 events with virtual capital. Buy straddle 2-3 days before. Track daily P&amp;L. Practice exit timing. Learn volatility behavior without risking money.</p>
<p><strong>Month 2: Small Real Straddle</strong></p>
<p>Deploy ₹15,000-20,000 on single straddle before minor event. Use weekly expiry. Exit immediately after event regardless of result. Experience real emotions and timing challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3: Timing Optimization</strong></p>
<p>Test different entry timings: 1 day before vs 3 days before vs 5 days before events. Measure which timing gives best risk-reward. Optimize your personal approach.</p>
<p><strong>Month 4: Position Sizing</strong></p>
<p>Never risk more than 5-8% of capital per straddle. Accept that 40-50% of straddles may lose money. Focus on capturing 1-2 big winners monthly. Size positions for sustainability.</p>
<p>Review quarterly: Track win rate and average profit/loss ratio. Successful straddle traders typically win 40-50% of trades but winners are 2-3x bigger than losers. Adjust entry criteria if needed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Straddle offers unique way to profit from market volatility without directional bias. When correctly timed around events with low initial volatility, strategy can generate significant returns from price swings.</p>
<p>Success requires patience in waiting for proper setups rather than forcing trades. Low VIX, clear catalyst, and appropriate expiry selection are mandatory preconditions.</p>
<p>Risk management through position sizing and swift exit discipline matters more than perfect entry timing. Take profits when volatility expands rather than hoping for maximum moves.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What is the minimum capital needed to trade straddle on Nifty?</h3>
<p>You need ₹15,000-25,000 for single ATM straddle typically depending on volatility and expiry. Weekly straddles cost ₹15,000-18,000. Monthly straddles need ₹22,000-25,000. Budget for total premium payment upfront.</p>
<h3>Should I use ATM or OTM strikes for straddle in Indian markets?</h3>
<p>Always use ATM strikes for pure straddle to maximize gamma and symmetry. Both call and put at same strike. OTM strikes create strangle which is different strategy requiring bigger moves.</p>
<h3>What happens if I hold straddle till expiry and market stays flat?</h3>
<p>You lose entire premium paid if Nifty expires exactly at your strike. Both call and put expire worthless. This is maximum loss scenario. Always exit before final 2-3 days to avoid this.</p>
<h3>How does straddle perform if volatility drops after I buy it?</h3>
<p>Volatility crush hurts straddles significantly. Both call and put lose value even without price movement. This is major risk. Enter only when VIX is low and expecting expansion not contraction.</p>
<h3>Can I adjust straddle position if market moves strongly in one direction?</h3>
<p>Yes, when one leg profits substantially, consider booking partial profit or converting to directional spread. Don&#39;t hold losing leg hoping for reversal. Adjust based on technical outlook and remaining time.</p>
<hr>
<div class="important-notes"><p><strong>Important Notes:</strong>
*Expiry schedules and lot sizes subject to NSE revisions per circulars. Straddles involve paying substantial premium upfront with risk of total loss. Past event movements don&#39;t guarantee future volatility patterns. Options trading requires understanding of Greeks, implied volatility, and time decay effects. This guide is for educational purposes only. Consult a SEBI-registered advisor before trading. Practice extensively with paper trading and small positions before deploying significant capital. Never risk more than 5-10% of total capital on single straddle position.</p>
