<h2>Executive Summary</h2><div class="executive-summary">
<p>Iron condor is a neutral options strategy profiting from range-bound markets. Over 1 lakh Indian traders use this strategy monthly. This guide covers complete iron condor implementation for Nifty options.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll learn construction, risk management, adjustment techniques, and profit maximization. The focus is practical execution for traders with 6+ months options experience.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Win rate in true range-bound markets: 65-75%</li>
<li>Capital required: ₹7,500-12,000 per position</li>
<li>Maximum profit: Premium collected</li>
<li>Risk-reward ratio: Typically 1:1 to 1:1.5</li>
<li>Best success: VIX below 13</li>
<li>Ideal holding period: 5-10 days</li>
<li>Nifty lot size: 75 units (as of Nov 2025, subject to NSE revisions)*</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Iron condor combines two credit spreads simultaneously. You sell OTM call spread and OTM put spread. This creates a profit zone in the middle.</p>
<p>Most markets trade sideways 60-70% of the time. Directional moves are rare. Iron condor profits from this reality.</p>
<p>The strategy benefits from theta decay and low volatility. Time is your friend here, unlike directional trades. Premium collected decays to zero if Nifty stays in range.</p>
<p><strong>Why Iron Condor Works:</strong></p>
<p>Markets consolidate after big moves. Traders wait for direction. This creates perfect range-bound conditions.</p>
<p>Theta decay works on four options simultaneously. Your profit accumulates daily. No need for Nifty to move favorably.</p>
<p>Defined risk on both sides reduces stress. You know maximum loss upfront. No unlimited risk like naked option selling.</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Trade Iron Condor:</strong></p>
<p>Traders with 6+ months options experience. You need to understand spreads first. Master bull call and bear put spreads before attempting this.</p>
<p>Those comfortable managing multiple positions. Four legs require attention. Not suitable for set-and-forget traders.</p>
<p>Traders with patience for sideways markets. If you need daily action, this isn&#39;t for you. Iron condor needs market to do nothing.</p>
<hr>
</div><h2>Understanding Iron Condor Structure</h2>
<h3>What is an Iron Condor</h3>
<p>An iron condor has four legs spread across two credit spreads. It looks complex but follows simple logic.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Spread (Bear Call Spread):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell OTM call (resistance)</li>
<li>Buy further OTM call (protection)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Spread (Bull Put Spread):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell OTM put (support)</li>
<li>Buy further OTM put (protection)</li>
</ul>
<p>Between the two sold strikes, you have a profit zone. Nifty must stay within this range.</p>
<h3>Example Setup: Complete Iron Condor</h3>
<p>Nifty at 21,400</p>
<p><strong>Upper Spread:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell 21,600 CE at ₹60</li>
<li>Buy 21,700 CE at ₹30</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹30</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Spread:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell 21,200 PE at ₹55</li>
<li>Buy 21,100 PE at ₹25</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹30</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total Credit:</strong> ₹60 × 75 = ₹4,500 (maximum profit)</p>
<p><strong>Profit Zone:</strong> 21,200 to 21,600 (400-point range)</p>
<h3>Why Four Legs Instead of Two</h3>
<p>Selling naked options has unlimited risk. One side can blow up your account.</p>
<p>Buying protection (the outer strikes) caps your maximum loss. You sleep better at night.</p>
<p>The cost is reduced profit. Protection isn&#39;t free. But defined risk is worth it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to Use Iron Condor</h2>
<h3>Ideal Market Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Consolidation Phase:</strong> Nifty trading in 300-400 point range for 3+ days. No breakout attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Low Volatility:</strong> India VIX below 13. High VIX makes premiums expensive. Iron condor needs cheap premiums.</p>
<p><strong>No Major Events:</strong> No RBI policy, budget, or global events within 7-10 days. Events break ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Setup:</strong> Nifty between strong support and resistance. Clear boundaries established.</p>
<h3>When to Avoid Iron Condor</h3>
<p><strong>Trending Markets:</strong> Strong uptrend or downtrend. Nifty making higher highs or lower lows. Don&#39;t fight trends.</p>
<p><strong>High Volatility:</strong> VIX above 16. Premiums too expensive. Risk-reward becomes unfavorable.</p>
<p><strong>Event Week:</strong> Budget week, RBI policy, Fed announcement. Gaps destroy iron condors overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Weak Support/Resistance:</strong> No clear range boundaries. Nifty could break either direction easily.</p>
<h3>VIX Considerations</h3>
<p>VIX below 12: Excellent for iron condor. Premiums low. Theta works beautifully.</p>
<p>VIX 12-14: Good conditions. Slight risk but manageable. Monitor closely.</p>
<p>VIX 14-16: Borderline. Consider skipping or using wider spreads. Risk increasing.</p>
<p>VIX above 16: Avoid iron condor. Too risky. High probability of range breaks.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step-by-Step Iron Condor Construction</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Identify the Range</h3>
<p>Look at last 5-7 days. Note Nifty&#39;s high and low. This establishes range boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Nifty last 7 days: High 21,480, Low 21,320. Range is 160 points.</p>
<p>For iron condor, you want 300-400 point range minimum. Tighter ranges risk getting tested.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Determine Strike Prices</h3>
<p><strong>Current Nifty:</strong> 21,400 (assumed ATM)</p>
<p><strong>Upper Spread Strikes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell strike: 200-250 points above current (21,600 or 21,650)</li>
<li>Buy strike: 100 points above sell strike (21,700 or 21,750)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Spread Strikes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell strike: 200-250 points below current (21,150 or 21,200)</li>
<li>Buy strike: 100 points below sell strike (21,050 or 21,100)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Keep 200-300 points buffer from current price to sold strikes. This increases win rate.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Check Premium Values</h3>
<p>Look at option chain. Note premiums for your selected strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Spread:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>21,600 CE: ₹60 (sell)</li>
<li>21,700 CE: ₹30 (buy)</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹30</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Spread:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>21,200 PE: ₹55 (sell)</li>
<li>21,100 PE: ₹25 (buy)</li>
<li>Net credit: ₹30</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total credit:</strong> ₹60 per contract × 75 lot size = ₹4,500</p>
<p>Target minimum ₹50-70 total credit per contract. Below ₹50 isn&#39;t worth the risk.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Calculate Risk-Reward</h3>
<p><strong>Maximum Profit:</strong> Total premium collected = ₹4,500</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Loss per side:</strong> (Spread width - Net credit) × Lot size</p>
<p>Upper side max loss: (100 - 60) × 75 = ₹3,000
Lower side max loss: (100 - 60) × 75 = ₹3,000</p>
<p><strong>Overall max loss:</strong> ₹3,000 (one side only gets tested)</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Reward:</strong> ₹3,000 risk for ₹4,500 reward = 1:1.5</p>
<h3>Step 5: Execute the Trade</h3>
<p>Place all four orders simultaneously. Use &quot;Order Window&quot; feature in your trading platform.</p>
<p><strong>Order 1:</strong> Sell 21,600 CE (1 lot)
<strong>Order 2:</strong> Buy 21,700 CE (1 lot)
<strong>Order 3:</strong> Sell 21,200 PE (1 lot)
<strong>Order 4:</strong> Buy 21,100 PE (1 lot)</p>
<p>Execute as limit orders, not market orders. This ensures you get desired credits.</p>
<p>If all four don&#39;t fill together, cancel and retry. Don&#39;t create partial iron condor.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Profit and Loss Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Maximum Profit Scenario</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Nifty expires between 21,200 and 21,600</p>
<p>All four options expire worthless. You keep entire ₹4,500 premium collected.</p>
<p>This happens 65-75% of the time in genuine range-bound conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Entry at Nifty 21,400. Expiry at Nifty 21,450. All OTM. Full profit.</p>
<h3>Breakeven Points</h3>
<p><strong>Upper Breakeven:</strong> Sell call strike + Total credit collected</p>
<p>21,600 + 60 = 21,660</p>
<p><strong>Lower Breakeven:</strong> Sell put strike - Total credit collected</p>
<p>21,200 - 60 = 21,140</p>
<p>As long as Nifty between 21,140 and 21,660, you profit. That&#39;s 520-point range.</p>
<h3>Maximum Loss Scenarios</h3>
<p><strong>Upper Side Breach:</strong> Nifty expires above 21,700</p>
<p>Upper spread maxes out at ₹100 difference.
Lower spread expires worthless.</p>
<p>Calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium collected: ₹4,500</li>
<li>Upper spread loss: (21,700 - 21,600) × 75 = ₹7,500</li>
<li>Net loss: ₹7,500 - ₹4,500 = ₹3,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Side Breach:</strong> Nifty expires below 21,100</p>
<p>Lower spread maxes out. Loss = ₹3,000
Upper spread expires worthless.
Net loss: ₹3,000</p>
<h3>Partial Profit Scenarios</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Nifty at 21,550 at expiry (near upper sold strike)</p>
<p>Upper spread has small value (₹50 intrinsic). Lower spread worthless.</p>
<p>Loss on upper spread: ₹50 × 75 = ₹3,750
Premium collected: ₹4,500
Net profit: ₹750</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Nifty at 21,250 at expiry (near lower sold strike)</p>
<p>Lower spread has small value. Upper spread worthless.</p>
<p>Similar calculation: Small profit or breakeven.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Managing the Iron Condor</h2>
<h3>Daily Monitoring</h3>
<p>Check position twice daily minimum. Morning at 10 AM, afternoon at 2 PM.</p>
<p>Track Nifty&#39;s distance from your sold strikes. Ideal: 150-200 points buffer maintained.</p>
<p>Monitor India VIX. Rising VIX increases risk. Falling VIX benefits your position.</p>
<h3>When to Exit Early</h3>
<p><strong>Target Hit:</strong> Position value drops to 30-40% of credit received. Book 60-70% profit.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Collected ₹4,500. Position value now ₹1,800. Exit for ₹2,700 profit.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t wait for 100% profit. Theta slows near expiry. Risk increases.</p>
<p><strong>Time-Based Exit:</strong> 2 days before expiry. Gamma risk increases. Close all legs.</p>
<p><strong>Danger Zone Approach:</strong> Nifty within 100 points of either sold strike. Consider exiting threatened side.</p>
<h3>Rolling the Iron Condor</h3>
<p>If Nifty approaches one side early in cycle, you can roll to next week.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Side Threatened:</strong> Close upper spread. Open new upper spread further out.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Nifty at 21,550 on Monday (8 days to expiry).</p>
<p>Close 21,600/21,700 call spread. Open 21,700/21,800 call spread.</p>
<p>Cost: Small debit usually. But extends profit zone.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Under Threat</h3>
<p><strong>Option 1: Close Threatened Side</strong></p>
<p>Nifty breaks 21,550 heading toward 21,600. Close upper call spread immediately.</p>
<p>Take small loss on upper (₹750-1,500). Keep lower spread for continued profit.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Convert to Butterfly</strong></p>
<p>Close buy side of threatened spread. Sell another spread at next strike.</p>
<p>Complex adjustment. Only for experienced traders.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3: Exit Entirely</strong></p>
<p>If both sides getting tested (high volatility), exit completely. Accept loss.</p>
<p>Fighting extreme moves destroys accounts. Live to trade another day.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Understanding Greeks in Iron Condor</h2>
<h3>Theta: Your Best Friend</h3>
<p>You have four short options and four long options. Net theta is positive.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Theta Decay:</strong> Approximately ₹150-225 per day typically.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Monday position value ₹4,500. Tuesday (no price change) value ₹4,275.</p>
<p>Theta works 24/7. Weekends help too. Each passing day is profit.</p>
<p><strong>Acceleration:</strong> Theta decay accelerates last 7 days. Maximum benefit final week.</p>
<h3>Delta: Staying Neutral</h3>
<p>Iron condor starts delta neutral. Equal calls and puts sold.</p>
<p>As Nifty moves, delta changes. Moving up increases positive delta. Moving down increases negative delta.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Keep delta between -15 and +15 (for 75 lot size).</p>
<p>If delta reaches ±30, consider adjustments. One side is getting tested.</p>
<h3>Gamma: The Hidden Risk</h3>
<p>Gamma is your enemy in iron condor. It represents delta acceleration.</p>
<p>Near expiry, ATM options have extreme gamma. Your sold strikes are far OTM, so gamma is low initially.</p>
<p>If Nifty approaches sold strike, gamma explodes. Small Nifty moves create huge P&amp;L swings.</p>
<p><strong>Protection:</strong> Exit or adjust before Nifty reaches sold strikes. Don&#39;t fight gamma.</p>
<h3>Vega: Volatility Impact</h3>
<p>You&#39;re short vega overall. Increasing volatility hurts your position.</p>
<p><strong>VIX Rises 2 points:</strong> Your position loses ₹600-900 typically.</p>
<p><strong>VIX Falls 2 points:</strong> Your position gains ₹600-900 typically.</p>
<p>This is why VIX below 13 is ideal entry condition. Room for VIX to fall further.</p>

<h2>Real Iron Condor Trade Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Perfect Range-Bound Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, October 28, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Nifty at 21,350. Trading 21,300-21,450 range for 6 days. VIX at 11.5.</p>
<p><strong>Entry:</strong> 10:30 AM Monday</p>
<p>Sell 21,600 CE at ₹58. Buy 21,700 CE at ₹28. Credit: ₹30
Sell 21,200 PE at ₹52. Buy 21,100 PE at ₹22. Credit: ₹30</p>
<p>Total credit: ₹60 × 75 = ₹4,500</p>
<p><strong>Management:</strong> Nifty ranged between 21,320-21,480 entire week. Perfect conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Exit:</strong> Wednesday (9 days later), 2 days before expiry</p>
<p>Position value: ₹1,350 (70% decay). Bought back all four legs.</p>
<p><strong>Profit:</strong> ₹4,500 - ₹1,350 = ₹3,150 (70% of maximum profit)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 days holding period. Theta decay worked perfectly.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Upper Side Adjustment Required</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, November 4, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Nifty at 21,400. VIX at 12.8. Range 21,300-21,500 established.</p>
<p><strong>Entry:</strong> Same as Example 1 structure</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Thursday, Nifty breaks 21,500 resistance. Rallies to 21,580.</p>
<p>Upper side threatened. 21,600 CE now trading ₹85 (was ₹58).</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Close upper call spread immediately.</p>
<p>Buy back 21,600 CE at ₹85. Sell 21,700 CE at ₹45.</p>
<p>Upper spread loss: (85 - 58 - 45 + 28) × 75 = ₹750 loss</p>
<p><strong>Continue:</strong> Keep lower put spread running. Nifty stabilizes 21,550-21,600.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exit:</strong> Friday before expiry</p>
<p>Lower put spread collected full ₹30 credit = ₹2,250
Upper adjustment loss: ₹750
Net profit: ₹1,500</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Quick adjustment saved ₹2,250. Without adjustment, upper side would have maxed out.</p>
<h3>Example 3: Failed Trade - Exit with Loss</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, November 11, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Nifty at 21,450. VIX 13.2 (bit high but acceptable).</p>
<p><strong>Entry:</strong> Standard iron condor structure</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tuesday gap down 250 points on global selloff. Nifty opens 21,200.</p>
<p>Lower put spread immediately tested. 21,200 PE now ITM.</p>
<p><strong>Decision:</strong> Exit entire position immediately at 11 AM Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Loss Calculation:</strong></p>
<p>Upper spread: Closed at profit (calls worthless). Gain ₹2,250
Lower spread: Closed at loss. Loss ₹6,000
Net loss: ₹3,750</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Gap openings are iron condor&#39;s worst enemy. Exit fast. Don&#39;t hope for recovery.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Advanced Iron Condor Techniques</h2>
<h3>Unbalanced Iron Condor</h3>
<p>Skew ratio based on market bias. If slightly bullish, make put spread wider.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call spread: 100-point width</li>
<li>Put spread: 150-point width</li>
</ul>
<p>Collects more premium on put side. Accommodates small upward bias.</p>
<p>Only for experienced traders. Requires good directional sense.</p>
<h3>Weekly vs Monthly Iron Condor</h3>
<p><strong>Weekly Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Faster theta decay</li>
<li>Can execute 4 times per month</li>
<li>Lower capital per trade</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Larger profit per trade</li>
<li>Less stressful management</li>
<li>More time for adjustments</li>
</ul>
<p>Beginners: Start with monthly. Move to weekly after consistency.</p>
<h3>Multiple Iron Condors</h3>
<p>Trade 2-3 iron condors with different expiries. Smooth out returns.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron Condor 1: This week expiry</li>
<li>Iron Condor 2: Next week expiry</li>
<li>Iron Condor 3: Monthly expiry</li>
</ul>
<p>Diversifies risk across time. One failure doesn&#39;t destroy month.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Iron Condor Mistakes</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Trading in Trending Markets</strong></p>
<p>Biggest error. Setting up iron condor when Nifty clearly trending.</p>
<p>Result: One side gets destroyed. Maximum loss realized. Learn to identify trends first.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Too Narrow Wings</strong></p>
<p>Using 50-point spreads to collect more premium. Risk is too high.</p>
<p>Nifty moves 50 points easily. Your spread maxes out frequently. Use 100-point minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Not Taking Profits</strong></p>
<p>Holding for 100% profit. Theta slows last 2 days. Risk increases.</p>
<p>Take 60-70% profit. Redeploy capital into new iron condor.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Ignoring VIX</strong></p>
<p>Setting up iron condor when VIX is 18. Premium looks attractive.</p>
<p>But high VIX signals trouble ahead. Range likely to break. Wait for VIX below 14.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: Over-Leveraging</strong></p>
<p>Trading 5-10 iron condors simultaneously with small account. One bad event destroys everything.</p>
<p>Trade 1-2 maximum per expiry cycle. Scale gradually after consistent profits.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 6: No Adjustment Plan</strong></p>
<p>Entering trade without knowing what to do if threatened. Panic decisions follow.</p>
<p>Plan adjustments before entry. Know your exit triggers precisely.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Risk Management for Iron Condor</h2>
<h3>Position Sizing</h3>
<p>With ₹1 lakh capital, trade 1-2 iron condors maximum. Each has ₹7,500-12,000 capital requirement.</p>
<p>Keep 70% capital as buffer. Market opportunities come unexpectedly.</p>
<h3>Stop-Loss Rules</h3>
<p><strong>Position-Based Stop-Loss:</strong> Exit if position value reaches 1.5X credit received.</p>
<p>Example: Collected ₹4,500. Exit if position value hits ₹6,750. Loss = ₹2,250.</p>
<p><strong>Time-Based Stop-Loss:</strong> Exit 2 days before expiry regardless. Gamma risk too high.</p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t trade only iron condors. Mix with directional strategies. Balance your portfolio.</p>
<p>Iron condor works 70% of the time. Other 30% needs different strategies.</p>
<h3>Capital Allocation</h3>
<p>Allocate maximum 30% capital to iron condors. Keep 40% for directional trades. Reserve 30% cash.</p>
<p>This ensures you can handle unexpected volatility. Prevents forced exits at losses.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Iron condor profits from range-bound markets. Nifty stays sideways 60-70% of days.</p>
<p>Four-leg structure provides defined risk on both sides. Maximum loss is known upfront.</p>
<p>Best conditions: VIX below 13, established range, no events upcoming. Wait for these conditions.</p>
<p>Theta decay works in your favor daily. Time is your friend. Each day without price movement is profit.</p>
<p>Take profits at 60-70% of maximum. Don&#39;t wait for 100%. Redeploy capital faster.</p>
<p>Exit 2 days before expiry. Gamma risk increases exponentially. Book profits and move on.</p>
<p>Adjust quickly when threatened. Close threatened side or roll out. Don&#39;t freeze hoping for recovery.</p>
<p>Start with monthly expiries. Master basics before attempting weeklies. Complexity increases with shorter duration.</p>
<p>Trade 1-2 positions maximum per cycle. Over-leveraging destroys accounts during volatile events.</p>
<p>Paper trade minimum 10 iron condors before using real money. Understand adjustment mechanics thoroughly.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Month 1-2:</strong> Study iron condor mechanics. Understand profit/loss graphs. Learn to identify range-bound markets.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3-4:</strong> Paper trade 10 iron condors. Track every entry, adjustment, exit. Calculate success rate.</p>
<p><strong>Month 5:</strong> Start real trading with ₹50,000 capital. Trade 1 iron condor monthly expiry. Risk ₹7,500 maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Month 6-8:</strong> Introduce adjustments in live trading. Practice rolling threatened sides. Build confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Month 9-12:</strong> Scale to 2 iron condors per cycle if consistently profitable. Experiment with weekly options cautiously.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2:</strong> Refine strategy. Develop personal rules for entry/exit. Optimize based on your results.</p>
<p>Join options strategy communities. Share iron condor experiences. Learn from others&#39; mistakes.</p>
<p>Maintain detailed journal. Note VIX at entry, Nifty range, adjustments made, final outcome.</p>
<p>Review monthly performance. Calculate win rate, average profit, largest loss. Improve continuously.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Iron condor is a powerful strategy for profiting from range-bound Nifty markets. When executed with discipline, it generates consistent returns with defined risk.</p>
<p>Success requires patience for proper market conditions. Don&#39;t force iron condors in trending or high volatility environments. Wait for VIX below 13 and established ranges.</p>
<p>The strategy combines multiple options requiring active management. Quick adjustments and profit-taking separate winners from losers. Don&#39;t become complacent after initial success.</p>
<p>Most importantly, position sizing and risk management determine long-term survival. One oversized position in volatile conditions can destroy months of profits.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q1: What is the minimum capital required to trade Nifty iron condor strategy safely?</strong></p>
<p>Minimum ₹50,000 recommended for 1 iron condor position. Each position needs ₹5,000-8,000 capital plus buffer. With ₹1 lakh, you can comfortably manage 2 positions with proper risk management.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Should beginners start with iron condor or simpler strategies like long calls?</strong></p>
<p>Start with directional strategies first. Master bull call and bear put spreads for 6 months. Then progress to iron condor. It requires understanding four-leg positions and adjustment techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: What happens if Nifty gaps beyond my sold strikes overnight?</strong></p>
<p>Gap openings are iron condor&#39;s biggest risk. Exit immediately when market opens. Don&#39;t wait hoping for recovery. Accept loss and move on. This prevents maximum loss scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: How do I know when Nifty is truly range-bound for iron condor?</strong></p>
<p>Look for 5-7 days consolidation within 300-400 point range. Clear support-resistance levels. VIX below 13. No major events within 10 days. All these confirm range-bound conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Should I hold iron condor till expiry or exit early with partial profits?</strong></p>
<p>Exit at 60-70% of maximum profit, typically 7-10 days into monthly cycle. Don&#39;t hold till expiry. Gamma risk increases final 2 days. Book profits and redeploy capital.</p>
