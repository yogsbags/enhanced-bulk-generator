# Put Ratio Back Spread Nifty: Unlimited Downside Profit Guide 2025

**Last Updated:** November 2025 | **Reading Time:** 14 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

Put ratio back spread is an advanced volatility strategy that profits from strong downward breakdowns with unlimited profit potential. You sell fewer ATM puts and buy more OTM puts, creating a position that benefits from sharp declines while collecting initial credit or paying minimal debit.

This guide covers complete implementation, ratio optimization, breakdown positioning, and real Nifty examples. The focus is practical knowledge for capturing crash moves with defined risk and unlimited downside profit.

**Key Statistics:**

- Strategy type: Volatility expansion, unlimited downside profit
- Capital required: Net credit to small debit (₹0-5,000 typically)
- Maximum profit: Unlimited below lower breakeven (theoretically)
- Maximum loss: Limited, occurs at lower strike price
- Ideal market: Low volatility expecting sharp breakdown
- Nifty lot size: 75 units (subject to NSE revisions)*
- Best used in: Topping patterns before major corrections

---

Put ratio back spread suits aggressive traders expecting sharp corrections or crashes. Unlike protective puts or bear spreads, this profits from volatility expansion on downside. The asymmetric ratio (sell 1, buy 2 or sell 2, buy 3) creates unlimited profit potential below lower breakeven while maintaining defined risk.

Most traders miss crash moves due to expensive put premiums during fear. Put ratio back spread solves this by financing your long puts through short puts at higher strike. Often established for credit or minimal cost, giving you crash insurance with profit potential.

Professional volatility traders use this before corrections, at market tops, or when technical breakdowns developing. Market extended at resistance, VIX suppressed, negative catalyst emerging? Put ratio back spread positions you for sharp decline at minimal cost.

## Understanding Put Ratio Back Spread Mechanics

### What is Put Ratio Back Spread

Put ratio back spread combines puts at different strikes in specific ratio. You sell fewer higher strike puts and buy more lower strike puts.

**Structure (1:2 Ratio):**

- Sell 1 put at strike A (higher strike, receive premium)
- Buy 2 puts at strike B (lower strike, pay premium)
- Net cost = (2 × Premium paid for B) - (1 × Premium received for A)
- Same expiry date for all puts

This creates position with limited risk and unlimited reward. Maximum loss occurs at lower strike. Maximum gain is theoretically unlimited below lower breakeven (down to zero).

**Alternative Structure (2:3 Ratio):**

- Sell 2 puts at strike A
- Buy 3 puts at strike B
- Maintains 1:1.5 ratio for tighter spread management

**Classification:**

Put ratio back spread is a volatility spread. It's also called "reverse put ratio spread." The position is vega positive (benefits from volatility increase) and has negative delta below strikes.

Strategy is neither purely bullish nor bearish. It's explosively bearish below lower breakeven with limited profit in neutral zones and defined loss at lower strike.

### How Put Ratio Back Spread Works

**Scenario 1: Sharp Downward Crash**

Setup: Sell 1 × 24,000 put, Buy 2 × 23,800 puts. Nifty crashes to 23,200.

Your 24,000 put (short): ITM by 800 points. You owe 800 × 75 = ₹60,000.
Your 23,800 puts (long): ITM by 600 points each. Worth 600 × 75 × 2 = ₹90,000.
Net profit: ₹90,000 - ₹60,000 = ₹30,000 (minus any net debit paid).

Below 23,200, profit continues growing unlimited as Nifty falls toward zero.

**Scenario 2: Maximum Loss Zone**

Nifty expires exactly at 23,800 (your long strike).

Your 24,000 put is ITM by 200 points: Owe ₹15,000.
Your 23,800 puts expire worthless: Worth ₹0.
Loss: ₹15,000 + Net debit paid (if any).

This is maximum loss point. Worst case is known and limited to specific price.

**Scenario 3: Range-Bound Above Strikes**

Nifty expires at 24,100 (above both strikes).

All puts expire worthless. If you established for credit, you keep it. If small debit, that's your loss. Best case is market staying above strikes giving small profit from credit.

**Scenario 4: Between Strikes**

Nifty expires at 23,900 (between strikes).

Your 24,000 put is ITM by 100 points: Owe ₹7,500.
Your 23,800 puts expire worthless.
Small loss or profit depending on initial credit received.

### Credit vs Debit Setup

**Credit Setup (Ideal):**

- Nifty at 24,000
- Sell 1 × 24,000 put at ₹180 (receive ₹13,500)
- Buy 2 × 23,800 puts at ₹85 each (pay ₹12,750)
- Net credit: ₹750

You receive money upfront. If market stays above 24,000, you keep ₹750 profit. Maximum loss ₹14,250 at 23,800.

**Small Debit Setup:**

- Sell 1 × 24,000 put at ₹180
- Buy 2 × 23,750 puts at ₹95 each (pay ₹14,250)
- Net debit: ₹750

Small cost for unlimited downside profit. Maximum loss ₹19,500 at 23,750 (wider spread).

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Market Analysis

Identify topping patterns and potential breakdown catalysts.

**Technical Assessment:**

- Price at resistance or all-time highs
- Bearish divergence on RSI or MACD
- Volume declining on rallies (weak upside)
- Distribution patterns forming

**Volatility Assessment:**

- India VIX below 15 (suppressed volatility)
- Market complacent at highs
- Historical volatility at lows
- Fear gauge near multi-month lows

**Catalyst Identification:**

- Major resistance overhead (psychological level, gap resistance)
- Negative global setup (Fed hawkish, global slowdown)
- Domestic concerns (fiscal deficit, inflation data)
- Technical breakdown setup (head and shoulders, double top)

**Breakdown Probability:**

Study support and resistance. If Nifty at 24,200 resistance for third time with weakening momentum, breakdown likely. Put ratio back spread captures downside with unlimited profit.

### Step 2: Ratio Selection

Choose ratio based on credit/debit and crash expectation.

**1:2 Ratio (Most Common):**

- Sell 1 put, buy 2 puts
- Easier to get credit or minimal debit
- Wider profit zone below lower breakeven
- Maximum loss at lower strike manageable

**2:3 Ratio (Tighter Management):**

- Sell 2 puts, buy 3 puts
- Requires more margin
- Steeper profit acceleration below breakeven
- Double the maximum loss point

**1:3 Ratio (Aggressive Crash Play):**

- Sell 1 put, buy 3 puts
- Usually costs debit
- Massive profit on severe crashes
- Wider lower breakeven point

Start with 1:2 ratio until comfortable with mechanics. Best balance of cost, risk, and crash profit potential.

### Step 3: Strike Selection

**Higher Strike (Sell):** Choose ATM or slightly ITM.

If Nifty is 24,000, sell 24,000 or 24,050 put. ATM maximizes credit received. Slightly ITM increases credit but also maximum loss.

**Lower Strike (Buy):** Choose 100-300 points below sold strike.

For 24,000 sell, buy 23,800 or 23,700 puts. Tighter spread (100-150 points) reduces cost but increases maximum loss. Wider spread (250-300 points) may require debit but smaller maximum loss zone.

**Strike Selection Rules:**

- Keep spread width 150-300 points for Nifty
- Aim for credit or maximum ₹5,000 debit
- Calculate maximum loss before entering (must be acceptable)
- Lower breakeven should align with support breakdown level
- Check liquidity on both strikes (OI 50,000+ each)
- Buy strike should be near next major support

### Step 4: Expiry Selection

Choose expiry matching catalyst timeframe and correction expectation.

**Weekly Expiry (Tuesday)*:**

- Expecting sharp correction within 7-10 days
- Lower premium cost
- Less time for breakdown to develop
- Higher gamma risk if market pins

**Monthly Expiry:**

- 15-30 day window for topping process
- Higher credit potential
- More time cushion for breakdown
- Better for technical top formations

Enter with 10-20 days to expiry for optimal setup. Avoid entering with less than 7 days (insufficient time for crash) or more than 30 days (excessive time decay cost).

### Step 5: Execute the Trade

Place all legs simultaneously as complex order.

**Execution Steps:**

1. Calculate exact ratio (1:2 most common)
2. Select "Multi-leg Strategy" in platform
3. Enter: Sell 1 × Strike A, Buy 2 × Strike B
4. Set limit price for net credit/debit
5. Verify margin requirement
6. Place order

If platform doesn't support multi-leg:
- First: Sell the higher strike puts
- Second: Buy the lower strike puts (2× quantity) immediately
- Third: Verify position reflects correctly

### Step 6: Position Management

**Rule 1: Exit on Breakdown**

When Nifty breaks below lower strike with momentum, monitor closely. Exit when profit reaches 2-3× maximum loss amount or on reversal signals.

**Rule 2: Defend at Maximum Loss**

Market approaching your long strike with little time left? Consider rolling down both strikes or exiting to limit loss.

**Rule 3: Early Exit if No Breakdown**

If catalyst passes without breakdown and market stays above strikes, exit for small profit (if credit) or small loss (if debit). Don't hold hoping for late crash.

**Rule 4: Time Management**

With 5 days to expiry, if no breakdown developing, close position. Gamma risk at lower strike accelerates. Better to reset than risk maximum loss.

## Risk and Reward Analysis

### Maximum Profit Calculation

**Formula:** Unlimited (Down to Zero Theoretically)

**Example (1:2 Ratio):**

- Sold 1 × 24,000 put at ₹180
- Bought 2 × 23,800 puts at ₹85 each
- Net credit: ₹750 (₹13,500 received - ₹12,750 paid)
- Lower breakeven: 23,800 - 200 + 7.50 = 23,607.50

For every point Nifty falls below 23,607.50:
- Short put loses ₹75 (1 contract × 75 lot)
- Long puts gain ₹150 (2 contracts × 75 lot each)
- Net gain: ₹75 per point

If Nifty crashes to 23,000 (607.50 points below lower breakeven):
Profit = 607.50 × 75 = ₹45,562.50

If Nifty crashes to 22,000 (1,607.50 points below):
Profit = 1,607.50 × 75 = ₹1,20,562.50

**Unlimited downside profit is key advantage for crash protection.**

### Maximum Loss Calculation

**Formula:** (Higher Strike - Lower Strike) - Net Credit (or + Net Debit)

Maximum loss = (24,000 - 23,800) - 7.50 = 192.50 per contract
For 1 spread: 192.50 × 75 = ₹14,437.50

This occurs when Nifty expires exactly at 23,800. Above this, loss decreases. Below this, position becomes profitable.

**Example with Debit:**

If you paid ₹2,000 net debit:
Maximum loss = (200 × 75) + 2,000 = ₹17,000

### Breakeven Points

**Upper Breakeven:** Sold Strike + Net Credit

If net credit ₹750 (₹10 per contract):
Upper breakeven = 24,000 + 10 = 24,010

Above 24,010, you lose the credit. Between 24,000-24,010, you profit from credit partially.

**Lower Breakeven:** Bought Strike - (Spread Width - Net Credit per Contract)

Lower breakeven = 23,800 - (200 - 10) = 23,610

Below 23,610, you make unlimited profit. Between 23,800-23,610, position is recovering from maximum loss zone.

### Risk-Reward Assessment

**Maximum Risk:** ₹14,437.50 (known and limited)
**Maximum Reward:** Unlimited (grows linearly below lower breakeven)

If expecting 10% crash (24,000 to 21,600), potential profit = 2,000+ points × 75 × 1 net long put = ₹1,50,000+.

Risk ₹14,437 to potentially make ₹1,50,000 = 10:1+ reward-risk on crash moves. This asymmetry provides crash insurance with profit.

## When to Use Put Ratio Back Spread

### Ideal Market Conditions

**Market at Resistance:**

Nifty at all-time highs or major resistance third time. Multiple rejections. Momentum weakening. Perfect setup for topping process and breakdown.

**Volatility Suppression:**

VIX declining to 11-13 levels despite market at highs. Complacency extreme. Fear gauge at lows while risk elevated. Classic pre-crash setup.

**Bearish Technical Patterns:**

Head and shoulders, double top, rising wedge forming. Volume declining on new highs. Distribution patterns visible. Anticipating breakdown with volatility spike.

**Negative Catalysts Emerging:**

Fed hawkish pivot, recession warnings, geopolitical tensions, domestic policy concerns. Fundamental headwinds building while market ignoring. Setup for reality check.

### Avoid This Strategy When

**High Volatility:**

VIX above 22-25. Premiums extremely expensive. Ratio back spread costs too much or impossible to establish for credit. Wait for volatility normalization.

**Strong Uptrends:**

Clear bull market in progress. Higher highs, higher lows. No distribution. Fighting strong momentum is low-probability. Wait for top formation.

**Near Major Support:**

Price at strong multi-month support. Historical demand zone. Low probability of breakdown through support without testing. Better to wait for breakdown confirmation.

**Post-Crash Environment:**

Market already corrected 10-15%. VIX elevated. Puts expensive. Ratio spread less effective after crash. Works best anticipating crash, not during it.

### Best Entry Timing

**Third Touch of Resistance:**

Market tested resistance twice, bounced. Third test forming. Probability of breakdown increases with each rejection. Enter anticipating third failure.

**Distribution Pattern Completion:**

Head and shoulders pattern nearly complete. Right shoulder forming. Neckline break would trigger crash. Enter before breakdown.

**Volatility Divergence:**

Market making new highs but VIX rising (unusual). Signals underlying nervousness. Put ratio spread positioned for volatility expansion.

**Pre-Event Positioning:**

Major bearish catalyst approaching (Fed meeting, earnings concerns). Enter 3-5 days before when premiums still reasonable. Capture event-driven volatility spike.

---

## Understanding Risk Factors

### Price Movement (Delta)

Put ratio back spread has unique delta profile. Near short strike, delta is slightly positive or neutral. Below long strike, delta turns negative and accelerates.

**Practical Impact:**

Small moves around current price have minimal P&L impact. Large downward moves create significant profits. This is exactly what you want - low cost for waiting, high reward for crash.

Position benefits from gamma below long strike. As Nifty falls through strikes, long puts accelerate while short put's negative gamma is offset by two long puts.

### Time Decay (Theta)

Time decay impact varies by position relative to strikes.

**Above Short Strike:**

Theta positive (benefits you). If established for credit and market stays above, time decay adds to profit daily.

**Near Long Strike (Maximum Loss Zone):**

Theta most negative here. Daily decay hurts. This is why you don't want market pinned at long strike with little time remaining.

**Below Long Strike:**

Theta becomes less relevant. Intrinsic value dominates. You're making money from direction and volatility, not time.

**Critical Period:** Last 7 days, gamma and theta accelerate at lower strike. If no breakdown by then, exit position to avoid maximum loss risk.

### Volatility Impact (Vega)

Volatility increase dramatically benefits ratio back spreads. This is primary profit driver besides direction on downside.

**Why This Matters:**

You enter when VIX is 12-14 (low complacency). Market tops, VIX spikes to 22-25 (fear). Your long puts (2×) gain massive value from volatility expansion. Short put (1×) gains less. Net vega is positive.

Even if Nifty doesn't fall much, volatility spike alone can generate 50-100% profit on the spread. Then if crash follows, profits compound dramatically.

**Volatility Crush Risk:**

If VIX spikes before you enter (market already falling) and then crashes, spread can lose value. Enter during low volatility at market tops, not after crash started.

## Real Nifty Examples

### Example 1: Major Correction Success

**Setup:**

- Date: October 18, 2025
- Nifty spot: 24,480 (all-time high)
- Technical: Third resistance test, bearish divergence
- India VIX: 12.6 (extreme complacency)
- Catalyst: Fed hawkish shift expected

**Trade Execution:**

- Sold 1 × 24,450 put at ₹170 (₹12,750)
- Bought 2 × 24,250 puts at ₹80 each (₹12,000)
- Net credit: ₹750
- Expiry: November 5, 2025
- Maximum loss: (200 × 75) - 750 = ₹14,250 at 24,250

**Position Details:**

- Upper breakeven: 24,460
- Lower breakeven: 24,060
- Profit zone: Above 24,460 or below 24,060

**Event Impact:**

October 25: Fed announces aggressive stance, global markets crash.
October 26: Nifty gaps down to 23,950, continues to 23,600.

**Result on October 28:**

- Nifty at 23,600 (460 points below lower breakeven)
- 24,450 put: ITM by 850 points, owe ₹63,750
- 24,250 puts (2×): ITM by 650 points each, worth ₹97,500
- Spread value: ₹97,500 - ₹63,750 = ₹33,750
- Initial credit: ₹750
- Profit: ₹33,750 + ₹750 = ₹34,500
- Return: Unlimited (started with credit, made ₹34,500)

**Exit Strategy:**

Closed on October 28 at 242× maximum loss (₹34,500 profit vs ₹14,250 max loss). Captured major crash move. VIX spike from 12.6 to 24.8 added significant value before directional move.

### Example 2: Maximum Loss Scenario

**Setup:**

- Date: November 8, 2025
- Nifty spot: 24,350 (at resistance)
- View: Expecting breakdown before RBI policy
- India VIX: 13.8

**Trade Execution:**

- Sold 1 × 24,300 put at ₹160 (₹12,000)
- Bought 2 × 24,100 puts at ₹75 each (₹11,250)
- Net credit: ₹750
- Expiry: November 19, 2025

**What Went Wrong:**

RBI policy was unexpectedly dovish. Market rallied instead of falling. Nifty drifted to exactly 24,100 by expiry (worst outcome).

**Result on November 19:**

- Nifty at 24,100 (pinned at long strike)
- 24,300 put: ITM by 200 points, owe ₹15,000
- 24,100 puts: ATM, worthless
- Loss: ₹15,000 - ₹750 credit = ₹14,250

**Key Lesson:**

Hit maximum loss point. Should have exited 5 days before expiry when market not breaking down. Holding cost ₹14,250 versus could have exited at ₹5,000-7,000 loss.

Bullish markets are enemy of put ratio back spreads. Need strong conviction on breakdown catalyst before deploying.

### Example 3: Volatility Spike Without Direction

**Setup:**

- Date: November 12, 2025
- Nifty spot: 24,280
- VIX: 11.8 (unsustainably low)
- Setup: No specific catalyst but VIX too compressed

**Trade Execution:**

- Sold 1 × 24,250 put at ₹145 (₹10,875)
- Bought 2 × 24,050 puts at ₹65 each (₹9,750)
- Net credit: ₹1,125

**Market Movement:**

Geopolitical concerns emerged suddenly. VIX spiked to 19.2 within 2 days. Nifty fell moderately to 24,150 (100 points only).

**Result on November 14:**

- Nifty at 24,150 (small decline)
- VIX at 19.2 (63% volatility spike)
- Spread value: ₹9,500 (from volatility expansion)
- Initial credit: ₹1,125
- Profit: ₹9,500 - ₹1,125 = ₹8,375

**Exit Timing:**

Exited on volatility spike before major directional move. Made profit purely from vega expansion. Nifty fell just 130 points but strategy profitable.

This demonstrates put ratio back spread's dual profit sources: crash direction AND volatility expansion.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Entering After Crash Started**

Deploying put ratio spread when market already falling 5%. VIX spiked, premiums expensive. Works best before crash, not during.

**Mistake 2: Wrong Ratio Selection**

Using 1:4 or 1:5 ratios for "massive crash profit." These cost huge debit and require unrealistic crashes. Stick to 1:2 or 2:3 ratios.

**Mistake 3: No Top Formation**

Random entry hoping for crash. Market can rally for months. Need topping pattern or strong resistance rejection before deploying.

**Mistake 4: Holding at Maximum Loss**

Market pinned at your long strike, 3 days to expiry. Holding hoping for breakdown. Exit early to reduce loss from maximum.

**Mistake 5: Ignoring Lower Breakeven**

Thinking any decline is profitable. Forgetting you need move below lower breakeven for unlimited profit. Calculate and mark this level clearly.

**Mistake 6: Over-Deployment**

Setting 3-4 put ratio back spreads simultaneously. One hits maximum loss, multiple losses compound. Limit to 1 spread per setup.

**Mistake 7: Fighting Bull Markets**

Deploying bearish strategies in strong uptrends. Low probability of success. Wait for clear top formation and distribution before entering.

---

## Key Takeaways

Put ratio back spread offers unlimited downside profit potential with defined limited risk. Asymmetric payoff makes it powerful for capturing crash moves and corrections.

Strategy works best entering during low volatility at market tops before breakdowns. VIX below 14 with market at resistance is ideal entry zone.

Ratio selection is critical. 1:2 ratio provides best balance of cost, risk, and crash profit for most traders. More aggressive ratios require larger crashes.

Maximum loss occurs at long strike price. This is known before entering. Calculate and ensure acceptable before deploying crash protection capital.

Time management is crucial. Exit 5-7 days before expiry if no breakdown developing. Gamma risk at lower strike accelerates in final week dramatically.

Top formation identification separates successful from unsuccessful setups. Need resistance rejection or distribution pattern, not random bearish hope.

Position benefits from dual sources: crash direction below lower breakeven AND volatility expansion. Even moderate decline with VIX spike can generate profits.

---

## Action Plan

**Week 1-2: Top Pattern Study**

Study historical Nifty charts for topping formations. Identify 10 instances where VIX was below 14 at resistance followed by breakdowns. Note triggers and patterns. Build reference database of crash setups.

**Week 3-4: Simulation Practice**

Paper trade 5 put ratio back spreads. Focus on entry timing (low VIX at tops). Track daily P&L from delta, theta, vega separately. Learn position behavior at different price levels. No real capital yet.

**Month 2: Small Live Setup**

Deploy single 1:2 ratio back spread with maximum loss under ₹12,000. Must have identified top formation. Enter only when VIX below 15 at resistance. Track Greek changes daily. Exit before expiry regardless of outcome.

**Month 3: Pattern Recognition**

Plan put ratio back spreads around resistance levels and distribution patterns. Enter when technical setup confirms. Exit on breakdown or time stop. Build catalog of pattern-based results.

**Month 4: Risk Optimization**

Identify optimal strike width (150-250 points). Compare credit versus debit setups for different volatility levels. Test exit timing (3 days versus 7 days before expiry). Determine your edge and refinement.

Review quarterly: Track ratio of breakdown successes to range-bound failures. Successful traders show 35-45% win rate but winning trades make 4-8× maximum loss on crashes. Adjust top identification to improve edge.

---

## Conclusion

Put ratio back spread delivers asymmetric risk-reward profile perfect for crash protection with profit potential. The unlimited downside profit combined with defined limited risk makes it powerful tool for market top positioning.

Strategy excels during complacent volatility at resistance levels before corrections or crashes. Proper entry timing during low VIX at tops is critical to cost management and success.

Success requires patience in top formation identification and discipline in exit timing. Not every resistance leads to crash. Identify high-probability distribution patterns and manage time decay actively.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: What is put ratio back spread strategy in Nifty options?**

Put ratio back spread involves selling fewer ATM puts and buying more OTM puts in ratio like 1:2. Creates position with unlimited downside profit below lower breakeven and defined limited loss at lower strike. Usually established for small credit or debit. Profits from sharp crashes and volatility expansion. Best for low volatility environments at market tops expecting breakdowns.

**Q2: How much does put ratio back spread cost for Nifty?**

Ideally established for small credit (₹500-2,000) or minimal debit (₹1,000-5,000 maximum). Credit setup means you receive money upfront. If paying debit, keep under ₹5,000 for single 1:2 spread. Maximum loss typically ₹12,000-18,000 depending on strike width. Much lower risk than buying multiple puts outright.

**Q3: When should I use put ratio back spread versus protective put?**

Use put ratio back spread when expecting sharp crash (7-15%+ decline) from market tops with profit motive. Established for credit or minimal cost. Use protective put when owning Nifty position and need insurance for existing holdings (portfolio protection). Protective put costs premium, ratio back spread can generate credit. Choose based on objective.

**Q4: What is maximum loss in put ratio back spread and where does it occur?**

Maximum loss occurs when Nifty expires exactly at your long strike (lower strike). Formula: (Short Strike - Long Strike) minus net credit or plus net debit. Example: Sell 24,000, Buy 23,800, net credit ₹500. Max loss = (200 × 75) - 500 = ₹14,500. This is worst case and happens only at specific price point.

**Q5: How do I manage put ratio back spread if breakdown doesn't happen?**

Exit 5-7 days before expiry if no breakdown developing. If established for credit and market above short strike, close for partial profit. If paying debit and market holding, exit at 50-75% of debit to minimize loss. Never hold till expiry hoping for late crash - gamma risk increases exponentially in final days.

<div class="important-notes">**Important Notes:**

*Lot sizes subject to NSE revisions. Weekly expiry on Tuesday per current schedule. Put ratio back spread is advanced strategy requiring experience with options Greeks and volatility trading. Maximum loss can be substantial if position held near lower strike till expiry. This guide is educational only. Options trading involves substantial risk especially with ratio spreads. Consult SEBI-registered advisor before implementing crash protection strategies. Past examples don't guarantee future results. Practice extensively with paper trading before risking real capital. Understand breakeven points clearly before entering positions. Strategy profits from market declines - ensure proper risk assessment.

Example: Sell 24,000, Buy 23,800, net credit ₹500. Max loss = (200 × 75) - 500 = ₹14,500. This is worst case and happens only at specific price point."

        "text": "Exit 5-7 days before expiry if no breakdown developing. If established for credit and market above short strike, close for partial profit. If paying debit and market holding, exit at 50-75% of debit to minimize loss. Never hold till expiry hoping for late crash - gamma risk increases exponentially in final days."
