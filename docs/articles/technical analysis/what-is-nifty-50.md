## Summary
This article covers the essentials of **What is Nifty 50?**, India's premier stock market benchmark. We analyze its current composition (November 2025), the critical lot size revision from 75 to 65 units (effective Jan 2026 contracts), and its dominance as the sole weekly expiry index on the NSE. The guide explains how the index works, its tax implications for FY 2025-26, and actionable strategies for both passive investors (ETFs) and active traders (F&O).

If you have ever watched the news and heard \"The market is up today,\" they are almost certainly talking about the Nifty 50. It is not just a number ticker on a screen; it is the financial heartbeat of the world's fifth-largest economy.

## The First-Ever NIFTY 50 Index

The Nifty 50 was not always the giant it is today. Launched by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on **April 22, 1996**, it started with a base value of 1,000. The base period selected was **November 3, 1995**, marking one year of operations for the NSE's capital market segment.

Think of it as the \"Class of 1995.\" Back then, the index was calculated using full market capitalization. It was a simpler time—no high-frequency trading, no mobile apps, and certainly no weekly expiries. The goal was straightforward: to create a barometer that accurately reflected the Indian equity market. Over nearly three decades, it has evolved from a manual trading benchmark to a globally traded derivative powerhouse, crossing the 26,000 mark in late 2025.

## The \"New\" NIFTY 50

Why do we call it the \"New\" Nifty 50? Because the index you see in November 2025 has fundamentally transformed in character and utility compared to even two years ago.

### 1. The Sole Weekly Expiry King
As per SEBI's regulatory overhaul in late 2024, exchanges were limited to offering weekly expiry contracts on just *one* benchmark index. NSE selected the Nifty 50. This decision effectively discontinued weekly contracts for Bank Nifty and Nifty Financial Services, funneling massive liquidity into Nifty 50 options. Today, **Tuesday** (Nifty's expiry day) is the most active trading day of the week.

### 2. Lot Size Revision (75 to 65)
As the index value climbed past 26,000, the contract value for a single lot (75 units) exceeded ₹19.5 lakh, making it capital-intensive for retail traders. To address this, NSE announced in November 2025 that the lot size will reduce to **65 units**, effective for contracts expiring from January 2026 onwards. This \"right-sizing\" keeps the index accessible while managing risk.

### 3. Modern Constituents
The \"New\" Nifty isn't just old industrial giants. It now includes new-age leaders like **Trent** (Retail), **Bharat Electronics (BEL)** (Defense), and **Shriram Finance**, reflecting India's shift toward consumption, defense indigenization, and financial deepening.

## What is an Index?

Imagine you want to know how the Indian economy is doing. You could track every single one of the 5,000+ listed companies, but that is impossible. Instead, you track a representative sample.

An index is like a **fruit basket**. If you want to know the price of fruit in the market, you don't check the price of every single apple, banana, and orange. You create a basket with 5 apples, 3 bananas, and 2 oranges. If the price of this basket goes up, you know fruit is getting expensive.

**What is Nifty 50?** It is a basket of the 50 largest, most liquid, and financially sound companies listed on the NSE. It spans 13 sectors—from Banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI) to IT (Infosys, TCS) to Energy (Reliance). When the Nifty 50 goes up, it means the aggregate value of these 50 companies has increased.

## Eligibility Criteria for Companies to Get Listed on NIFTY 50

Getting into the Nifty 50 is like making it to the national cricket team—it requires consistent high performance. The selection is rule-based, managed by NSE Indices Ltd. As of November 2025, a company must meet these strict criteria:

1.  **Listing History:** Must be listed on the NSE for at least 6 months.
2.  **Liquidity (Impact Cost):** This is crucial. The stock must have an average impact cost of **0.50% or less** for 90% of the observations over the last 6 months. This ensures you can buy or sell large quantities without moving the price significantly.
3.  **F&O Availability:** The stock *must* be available for trading in the Futures & Options segment. If a stock is banned from F&O, it cannot enter the Nifty 50.
4.  **Free-Float Market Capitalization:** The company must be among the top 50 eligible stocks by free-float market cap (value of shares available for public trading, excluding promoter holdings). Its free-float market cap must be at least **1.5 times** that of the smallest existing constituent.

**Rebalancing:** The index is reviewed semi-annually (cutoff dates: January 31 and July 31). If a stock fails these criteria, it is replaced by a better performer—a mechanism often called \"survival of the fittest.\"

## Benefits of Investing in Nifty 50 Index Funds

For most investors, trying to pick the \"next multi-bagger\" is a losing game. Investing in the Nifty 50 offers a smarter alternative.

| Benefit | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Automatic Diversification** | You own a slice of 13 sectors and 50 companies. If the IT sector is down, the Banking or Auto sector might be up, balancing your risk. |
| **Low Cost** | Nifty 50 Index Funds and ETFs are passive. They don't need expensive fund managers. Expense ratios are often **0.05% to 0.20%**, compared to 1.5% for active funds. |
| **Self-Cleansing** | This is the biggest advantage. If a company performs poorly (e.g., Yes Bank or Satyam in the past), it is automatically removed and replaced by a rising star. You don't need to monitor individual stocks. |
| **No Fund Manager Bias** | The fund simply mirrors the index. You don't have to worry about a fund manager making a bad call or taking cash calls at the wrong time. |

## How can you invest in the Nifty 50?

You cannot buy the \"Index\" directly like a stock. However, you have three primary ways to gain exposure:

### 1. Nifty 50 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
This is the most efficient method. You buy units of an ETF (like NiftyBees) on your trading terminal just like a share.
*   **Best for:** Long-term investors and swing traders.
*   **Cost:** Very low (Expense ratio < 0.10%).
*   **Liquidity:** High. You can buy/sell anytime during market hours.

### 2. Nifty 50 Index Mutual Funds
Similar to ETFs, but bought through a mutual fund house. You get the end-of-day NAV price.
*   **Best for:** SIP investors who want to automate their investments monthly.
*   **Action:** Set up a monthly SIP of ₹5,000 or ₹10,000 into a Nifty 50 Index Fund.

### 3. Nifty 50 Futures & Options (F&O)
This is for traders, not investors. You trade contracts based on the index value.
*   **Current Lot Size:** 75 units (reducing to 65 for Jan 2026 contracts).
*   **Expiry:** Weekly contracts expire every **Tuesday**.
*   **Risk:** Extremely high. This is a leveraged product.

**Important Note:** As per Finance Act 2025, gains from ETFs and Mutual Funds held for over 12 months are taxed at **12.5%** (LTCG) above ₹1.25 lakh. Short-term gains (STCG) are taxed at **20%**.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Benchmark Status:** Nifty 50 represents the top 50 diversified companies on the NSE, weighted by free-float market capitalization.
*   **Current Value:** Trading around the **26,200** level as of November 2025.
*   **Lot Size Update:** Currently **75**, but will reduce to **65** starting with January 2026 expiry contracts to keep contract value manageable.
*   **Weekly Expiry:** Nifty 50 is the **only** index with weekly options (Tuesday expiry) on NSE, concentrating liquidity.
*   **Tax Rules:** Be aware of the **12.5% LTCG** and **20% STCG** rates for FY 2025-26 when planning your withdrawals.
*   **Investment Route:** Use Index Funds/ETFs for wealth creation; use F&O only for hedging or short-term trading.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Foundation**
*   Open your demat account if you haven't already.
*   Check the current Nifty 50 PE ratio (approx. 22.8x in Nov 2025). If it is below 20, it's a value buy; above 24, be cautious.
*   Start a small SIP in a Nifty 50 Index Fund.

**Month 2: Education**
*   Track the index movement on Tuesdays (Expiry Day) to understand volatility.
*   Read the factsheet of your index fund to see the sector weights (Financials ~36%, IT ~10%).

**Month 3: Review**
*   Compare your Index Fund returns with active large-cap funds. You will often find the Index Fund winning due to lower costs.
*   If you trade F&O, note the lot size change schedule (Dec 2025 expiry is the last with 75 lot size).

## Conclusion

The Nifty 50 is more than just a market indicator; it is the simplest, most effective wealth-creation tool for the average Indian investor. By buying the Nifty, you are essentially buying a stake in India's corporate growth story without the headache of stock picking. Whether you are a conservative SIP investor or an aggressive F&O trader, understanding **What is Nifty 50?** is your first step toward financial mastery.
