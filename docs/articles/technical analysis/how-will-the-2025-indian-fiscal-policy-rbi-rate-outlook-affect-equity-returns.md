# How will the 2025 Indian fiscal policy & RBI rate outlook affect equity returns?

## Summary
This article examines how the 2025 Indian fiscal policy and RBI rate outlook influence equity returns in FY 2025‑26. We analyze budget measures, monetary stance, valuation metrics, sectoral effects, and craft a portfolio roadmap for mass‑affluent investors.

India’s 2025‑26 budget emphasizes fiscal consolidation, targeted tax incentives, and infrastructure spending, while the RBI signals a steady repo rate of 6.50% with a possible Q3 cut. Together, these macro levers reshape risk‑premia, valuation multiples, and sector rotation opportunities.

Key findings: • LTCG tax stays at 10% + 4% cess, easing after‑tax equity returns.
• Equity margin requirements remain at 20%.
• Nifty PE sits at 24.5×, suggesting modest overvaluation.
• Infrastructure and green energy sectors gain from fiscal stimulus, whereas financials face tighter credit spreads.

Our actionable plan guides you through asset allocation, risk management, and timing strategies for the coming year.

India’s fiscal and monetary policies are tightly inter‑woven. The Union Budget 2025‑26 introduced a ₹2.5 trillion infrastructure fund, expanded the Production‑Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and kept corporate tax at 22%/25% thresholds. Simultaneously, the RBI’s December 2025 monetary policy statement kept the repo rate at 6.50% and reaffirmed its 4% ± 2% inflation target. These moves aim to sustain growth while containing price pressures.

For salaried professionals and mass‑affluent investors, the macro backdrop translates into concrete portfolio implications. Lower LTCG surcharge improves after‑tax equity yields, while a stable repo rate supports equity‑bond correlation at historic lows. However, a Nifty PE of 24.5× signals that valuations are still elevated, urging a disciplined, sector‑tilted approach.

## Fiscal Policy Landscape

The Union Budget FY 2025‑26, released on 1 December 2025, outlines three pillars: fiscal prudence, growth‑oriented incentives, and social welfare. Key takeaways for equity investors include:

| Fiscal Measure | Amount / Rate | Direct Equity Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure fund | ₹2.5 trillion | Boosts construction, cement, steel demand |
| PLI scheme extension | ₹1.2 trillion across 7 sectors | Enhances export‑oriented manufacturers, tech hardware |
| Capital gains tax | LTCG 10% + 4% cess (no surcharge) | Improves after‑tax returns for long‑term holders |
| Corporate tax | 22% (≤ ₹400 cr turnover) / 25% (above) | Lowers cost of capital, supports earnings growth |
| Section 80C limit | ₹1.5 lakh unchanged | Encourages tax‑efficient savings, indirect equity inflow |
| Section 80CCD(1B) | Additional ₹50,000 for NPS | Increases retirement‑linked equity exposure |

As per the Finance Ministry press release dated 1 Dec 2025, the government expects a fiscal deficit of 5.8% of GDP for FY 2025‑26, marginally tighter than the previous year. The budget’s emphasis on capital expenditure (₹6 trillion) is expected to raise private‑sector participation in infrastructure projects, translating into higher order‑book growth for listed construction and engineering firms.

The removal of the LTCG surcharge, which previously added 10% for high‑income brackets, effectively raises net equity returns by up to 9% for those in the top tax slab (30%). This change, highlighted by the Finance Ministry, is likely to spur renewed inflows into equity mutual funds and direct stock purchases.

## RBI Rate Outlook and Monetary Stance

On 7 December 2025, the RBI released its monetary policy statement, keeping the repo rate at 6.50% and signalling a possible reduction to 6.25% in the third quarter of FY 2025‑26, contingent on inflation staying within the 4% ± 2% target band. The central bank also maintained the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 4.0% and the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) at 18.5%.

Key implications for equity markets:

* **Cost of Capital:** A stable repo rate keeps borrowing costs for corporates predictable, supporting earnings forecasts, especially for capital‑intensive sectors like infrastructure and renewable energy.
* **Equity‑Bond Correlation:** With interest rates unchanged, bond yields remain relatively flat, reducing the traditional flight‑to‑bond risk‑off flow during market corrections.
* **Liquidity:** RBI’s open‑market operations have injected an estimated ₹150 billion of liquidity this quarter, sustaining market depth.

According to the RBI’s December 2025 statement, inflation stood at 4.2% year‑on‑year, comfortably within the target range, allowing the central bank to consider a modest rate cut later in the fiscal year. However, any unexpected CPI spike could delay the cut, increasing equity risk premiums.

## Implications for Equity Valuations

Valuation metrics reflect both macro‑policy and market sentiment. As of 30 December 2025, the Nifty 50 PE ratio was 24.5×, up from 22.8× a year earlier (NSE data). While still below the historic peak of 30× seen in 2022, the current level suggests modest overvaluation.

**After‑Tax Return Calculations**

Assuming a pre‑tax equity return of 12% and an investor in the 30% tax slab:

* **LTCG (held > 1 yr):** 12% × (1 - 0.10 - 0.04) = **10.3%** after‑tax.
* **STCG (held ≤ 1 yr):** 12% × (1 - 0.15 - 0.04) = **9.3%** after‑tax.

These figures illustrate that the LTCG tax relief improves long‑term returns by roughly 1% absolute compared to the previous regime, a non‑trivial boost for portfolio compounding.

**Sector‑Specific Valuation Shifts**

| Sector | FY 2025‑26 PE Forecast | Drivers |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure | 22–24× | Govt fund, PLI extension, stable rates |
| Renewable Energy | 25–27× | Green incentives, lower financing costs |
| Financials | 18–20× | Higher NIM pressure, but credit growth support |
| Consumer Discretionary | 24–26× | Rising disposable income, but valuation caution |
| IT Services | 23–25× | Global demand, stable margins |

The table draws on consensus estimates from Bloomberg and sector reports released in December 2025. As per Bloomberg, infrastructure firms are expected to post a 14% earnings CAGR through FY 2026‑27, supported by the budget’s capital spending.

## Sectoral Impact Analysis

### Infrastructure & Construction
The ₹2.5 trillion infrastructure fund directly benefits listed construction houses, cement manufacturers, and steel producers. With the RBI’s repo rate steady at 6.50%, project financing costs remain manageable. Analysts at Motilal Oswal project a 12% revenue uplift for top‑10 construction stocks in FY 2025‑26.

### Renewable Energy & Green Tech
PLI extensions for solar and wind, coupled with a 30% accelerated depreciation for green assets (Budget 2025), make renewable equities attractive. The sector’s PE range of 25–27× reflects growth expectations, yet remains lower than the broader market, offering a valuation edge.

### Financial Services
Banks face a mixed picture. While stable rates preserve net interest margins (NIM), the removal of the LTCG surcharge may trigger capital inflows into equity‑linked products, increasing competition for deposits. Moreover, SEBI’s December 2025 margin requirement of 20% for equities keeps leverage in check, reducing systemic risk.

### Consumer Discretionary
Higher disposable incomes, driven by wage growth of 8% YoY (CMIE survey, Dec 2025), support demand for automobiles and retail. However, elevated valuations and potential rate cuts could trigger a rotation to value‑oriented stocks.

## Portfolio Construction Strategies

Given the macro backdrop, a balanced equity allocation of 55–60% of the investable portfolio is prudent for mass‑affluent investors. The remaining 40–45% can be split between debt, gold, and cash equivalents to manage volatility.

**Suggested Asset Mix (FY 2025‑26):**

| Asset Class | Allocation % | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Large‑Cap Equity (Nifty 50) | 30% | Core exposure, liquidity, dividend yield ~1.8% |
| Mid‑Cap & Small‑Cap | 15% | Higher growth upside, but higher volatility |
| Sectoral Thematic ETFs (Infrastructure, Green Energy) | 10% | Direct benefit from fiscal stimulus |
| Debt Instruments (AA‑rated bonds) | 25% | Stable income, lower correlation with equities |
| Gold | 5% | Hedge against inflation, aligns with RBI target band |
| Cash / Liquid Funds | 5% | Flexibility for opportunistic buying |

**Implementation Tips**
1. **SIP into thematic ETFs**: Allocate ₹10,000‑₹15,000 monthly to an Infrastructure ETF to capture gradual fund deployment.
2. **Use a staggered entry**: Deploy equity capital in tranches over the first two quarters to average cost, especially as the Nifty PE hovers near 24×.
3. **Maintain a 20% equity margin buffer**: Align with SEBI’s margin requirement to avoid forced liquidations during market dips.
4. **Rebalance semi‑annually**: Adjust sector weights based on quarterly earnings beats and policy updates.

## Understanding Risk Factors (Greeks Simplified)

While the article is not a deep options tutorial, investors holding equity‑linked derivatives should grasp the primary risk drivers:

* **Delta (Price Sensitivity):** A 1% move in Nifty translates to roughly a 0.8% change in a typical equity index fund’s NAV.
* **Theta (Time Decay):** For index options, theta erodes about ₹0.12 per contract per day as expiry approaches, emphasizing the need for timely exits.
* **Vega (Volatility Impact):** A 1% rise in implied volatility can increase option premiums by ~₹0.05, beneficial for sellers of covered calls.

**Practical Example:** An investor holds a Nifty 18,000 call option (strike 18,000) with a premium of ₹150. If Nifty rises to 18,200, the option’s delta of 0.55 adds ₹110 to the premium, while theta reduces it by ₹30 over two days, netting a gain of ₹80.

Understanding these Greeks helps in structuring covered‑call overlays to enhance yield without sacrificing core equity upside.
