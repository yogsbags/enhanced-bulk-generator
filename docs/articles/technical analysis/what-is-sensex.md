## Summary
This article covers the essentials of the S&P BSE Sensex, India's oldest stock market index. We analyze its composition of 30 financially sound companies, the free-float market capitalization method used for calculation, and its role as a barometer for the Indian economy. The guide explains how you can invest via index funds or derivatives, details the latest lot size (20 units) and expiry schedules (Tuesday) for FY 2025-26, and reviews major historical milestones including the recent 86,000 peak.

If you have ever watched the news, you have heard the phrase "Sensex is up" or "Sensex crashed." But what exactly is this number that seems to dictate the mood of the entire nation? For a mass affluent investor in India, understanding the Sensex is not just about trivia—it is about grasping the pulse of the market where your wealth grows. Whether you are a salaried professional starting an SIP or a trader eyeing the next expiry, this guide breaks down the "Pulse of Dalal Street" with data accurate as of November 2025.

## Understanding Sensex

The **Sensex** (Sensitive Index) is the benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Launched on January 1, 1986, it is the oldest stock index in India. Think of it as a report card for the Indian stock market. It tracks the performance of **30 largest and most actively traded companies** listed on the BSE. These 30 companies are not picked at random; they are financially sound, established giants from key sectors like banking, IT, energy, and FMCG.

When the Sensex goes up, it generally means these 30 major companies are doing well, and investor sentiment is positive. When it goes down, it signals caution or pessimism. As of November 2025, the Sensex hovers around the **85,700** mark, having recently touched an all-time high of approximately **86,055**.

### Key Characteristics (November 2025)
| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Full Name** | S&P BSE SENSEX |
| **Base Year** | 1978-79 |
| **Base Value** | 100 |
| **Number of Stocks** | 30 |
| **Calculation Method** | Free-float Market Capitalization |
| **Rebalancing Frequency** | Semi-annually (June & December) |

## How does the Sensex work?

The Sensex works as a representative sample of the entire market. Imagine you want to know the temperature of a swimming pool. You don't need to measure every drop of water; you just need a sample from different parts. Similarly, the Sensex samples 30 companies that represent various sectors of the economy.

### Sector Representation
The index ensures no single industry dominates completely, though financials typically hold the highest weightage. As of late 2025, the composition roughly follows this pattern (weights are dynamic):
*   **Financial Services:** HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Axis Bank
*   **Information Technology:** Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech
*   **Oil & Gas:** Reliance Industries
*   **FMCG:** ITC, Hindustan Unilever
*   **Automobile:** Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra

When these heavyweights move, they pull the index with them. For instance, a 5% rise in HDFC Bank (a heavyweight) will push the Sensex up significantly more than a 5% rise in a smaller constituent like Titan.

## How is Sensex calculated?

The Sensex uses the **Free-float Market Capitalization** method. This might sound technical, but the concept is simple. It only counts the shares available for trading by the public (free float), excluding shares locked in by promoters or governments.

### The Formula
**Sensex = (Total Free-float Market Cap of 30 companies / Base Market Cap) × Base Index Value (100)**

### Step-by-Step Calculation Example
1.  **Market Cap:** Calculate the total value of a company (Price × Total Shares).
    *   *Example:* Company A has 1,000 shares at ₹500 each = ₹5,00,000.
2.  **Free Float Factor:** Determine what % is available for trading.
    *   *Example:* Promoters hold 60%, so 40% is free float. Factor = 0.40.
3.  **Free-float Market Cap:** ₹5,00,000 × 0.40 = ₹2,00,000.
4.  **Aggregate:** Do this for all 30 companies and sum it up.
5.  **Index Value:** Apply the formula using the 1978-79 base divisor.

This method ensures that the index reflects the *investable* opportunity in the market, not just the total size of companies.

## How to Invest in Sensex?

You cannot buy "one unit of Sensex" directly like a stock. However, you can invest in products that mimic its performance. Here are the three primary ways to invest:

### 1. Index Mutual Funds
These funds replicate the Sensex portfolio. If Reliance is 10% of Sensex, the fund invests 10% of your money in Reliance.
*   **Pros:** Low expense ratio (typically 0.2% - 0.4%), automatic diversification.
*   **Cons:** No chance to beat the market (alpha).
*   **Taxation (FY 2025-26):** LTCG is **12.5%** (gains > ₹1.25 lakh); STCG is **20%**.

### 2. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
Sensex ETFs trade like stocks on the exchange. You need a Demat account to buy them.
*   **Liquidity:** Buy and sell anytime during market hours.
*   **Cost:** Generally lower than mutual funds, but you pay brokerage.

### 3. Sensex Derivatives (F&O)
For advanced traders, BSE offers Futures and Options contracts on the Sensex.
*   **Lot Size (Nov 2025):** **20 units** (Revised from 10 to 20 effective Nov 20, 2024).
*   **Expiry Day:** **Tuesday** (Weekly contracts expire every Tuesday).
*   **Risk:** High. This is for trading, not long-term investing.

> **Expert Insight:** "For most retail investors, a Sensex Index Fund is the simplest path to wealth creation. It bets on the growth of India's top 30 corporate giants without the stress of stock picking."

## Advantages of SENSEX

Why do millions of investors track this number?

1.  **Benchmarking:** It sets the standard. If your portfolio returned 12% while Sensex returned 15%, you underperformed the market.
2.  **Economic Barometer:** A rising Sensex often correlates with GDP growth, corporate earnings, and foreign investment inflows.
3.  **High Liquidity:** The 30 constituents are the most liquid stocks in India. You can enter or exit positions in these companies instantly.
4.  **Quality Filter:** To be in the Sensex, a company must have a proven track record. It automatically filters out smaller, riskier companies.

## Milestones of Sensex

The journey of Sensex mirrors the story of modern India. From a base of 100 in 1979, it has compounded wealth significantly.

| Milestone | Month/Year | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1,000** | July 1990 | Liberalization era begins |
| **10,000** | Feb 2006 | The great infrastructure bull run |
| **25,000** | May 2014 | Election euphoria (Modi 1.0) |
| **50,000** | Jan 2021 | Post-COVID recovery rally |

## Major Plunges in Sensex Stocks

Volatility is the price you pay for returns. The Sensex has faced severe crashes, yet it has always recovered to hit new highs.

### 1. Election Results Shock (June 4, 2024)
*   **Fall:** ~4,390 points intraday.
*   **Reason:** Election results defied exit polls, creating uncertainty about political stability. The market recovered fully within weeks.

### 2. COVID-19 Crash (March 23, 2020)
*   **Fall:** ~3,935 points (13.15%).
*   **Reason:** Global pandemic lockdown fears. This remains the absolute biggest single-day point fall in history.

### 3. Global Financial Crisis (January 21, 2008)
*   **Fall:** ~1,408 points.
*   **Reason:** The US housing market collapse triggered a global sell-off. Sensex eventually fell from 21k to 8k over the year.

### 4. Harshad Mehta Scam (April 28, 1992)
*   **Fall:** ~570 points (12.7%).
*   **Reason:** Exposure of a massive securities scam led to a sharp correction after a euphoric bull run.

## Key Takeaways

## Action Plan

**Month 2: Selection**
*   Choose between a Sensex Index Fund (for SIPs) or Sensex ETF (for lump sum).
*   Compare expense ratios; aim for <0.3% for index funds.

**Month 3: Execution**

*   If trading F&O, ensure you understand the new Tuesday expiry and lot size of 20.
