## Summary
This article analyzes the Fair Value Gap (FVG), a core component of Smart Money Concepts (SMC) used by institutional traders to identify market imbalances. We examine how FVG acts as a price magnet on Indian charts like Nifty 50 and Reliance Industries, offering high-probability entry zones. The guide covers identification techniques, risk management for FY 2025-26, and how recent regulatory changes—such as the discontinuation of Bank Nifty weekly expiries—impact FVG strategies.

Fair Value Gap (FVG) is a price action concept that highlights inefficiencies in the market where buying or selling pressure was so intense that it left a "gap" in liquidity. Unlike traditional gaps (like gap-ups at market open), an FVG occurs during continuous trading and is visible as a specific three-candle pattern. For Indian traders, spotting these zones is critical because price often returns to these levels to "rebalance" before continuing its trend. Think of FVG as a magnet: if a stock zooms up too fast, leaving an FVG, it often pulls back to that level to pick up unfilled orders. Mastering this helps you avoid chasing breakouts and instead wait for institutional-grade entries.

## Understanding the Mechanics of FVG

To grasp **what is FVG in trading**, you must look beyond standard support and resistance. An FVG represents a liquidity void—a price range where only one side of the market (buyers or sellers) participated aggressively. This creates an imbalance that the market algorithm typically seeks to correct.

### The Three-Candle Formation
Identifying an FVG requires analyzing a sequence of three consecutive candles. It is not about a single candlestick but the relationship between the first and the third candle in the sequence.

1.  **Candle 1 (The Setup):** This is the candle immediately preceding the large move.
2.  **Candle 2 (The Imbalance):** This is a large, impulsive candle with a big body, indicating strong momentum.
3.  **Candle 3 (The Confirmation):** This candle follows the impulsive move but fails to overlap with the range of Candle 1.

The **Fair Value Gap** is the empty space between the high of Candle 1 and the low of Candle 3 (in a bullish scenario). If the wicks of Candle 1 and Candle 3 touch or overlap, there is no FVG. The gap indicates that price moved so quickly that orders at those levels were not efficiently paired, leaving "unfinished business" on the chart.

### Why Price Returns to the Gap
Institutional algorithms drive modern markets. When large institutions like LIC or foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) buy huge quantities of Nifty futures, price spikes, leaving an FVG. These institutions often leave limit orders sitting in that gap. Therefore, price returns to this zone to fill those pending orders (mitigation) before resuming the trend. For a retail trader, this retracement is the "fair value" entry point.

## Types of Fair Value Gaps

FVGs are categorized based on the direction of the market imbalance. Recognizing the difference is vital for placing correct buy or sell orders.

### Bullish FVG (Undervalued Zone)
A Bullish FVG occurs during an uptrend or a strong upward move. It signals that buyers were so aggressive that sellers couldn't participate at certain price levels.

*   **Formation:** A large green candle (Candle 2) sits between Candle 1 and Candle 3.
*   **The Gap:** The space between **Candle 1's High** and **Candle 3's Low**.
*   **Action:** Traders wait for price to dip back into this gap to initiate a Long (Buy) position.
*   **Example:** If Nifty 50 rallies from 24,000 to 24,200, leaving a gap between 24,050 and 24,080, that 30-point zone is the Bullish FVG.

### Bearish FVG (Overvalued Zone)
A Bearish FVG forms during a downtrend, indicating intense selling pressure.

*   **Formation:** A large red candle (Candle 2) drives price down.
*   **The Gap:** The space between **Candle 1's Low** and **Candle 3's High**.
*   **Action:** Traders wait for price to rally back up into this gap to initiate a Short (Sell) position.
*   **Example:** If HDFC Bank drops from ₹1,600 to ₹1,550, leaving a gap between ₹1,590 and ₹1,580, that ₹10 range is the Bearish FVG.

## Trading FVG in the Indian Context (FY 2025-26)

Applying FVG strategies in India requires adapting to local market structure, liquidity, and recent regulatory changes effectively from November 2024.

### Impact of Regulatory Changes on FVG Trading
As of November 2025, SEBI and NSE have restructured the derivatives market. You must adjust your FVG strategy accordingly:

*   **Nifty 50 Dominance:** Since Nifty 50 is the only index with a weekly expiry (Thursdays), liquidity for weekly FVG setups is concentrated here. The lot size is **75 units** (as per NSE circular, valid for Nov 2025). This makes Nifty the prime candidate for intraday FVG scalping.
*   **Bank Nifty Shift:** With weekly contracts discontinued, Bank Nifty now only has monthly expiries. This reduces the viability of quick gamma-scalping strategies on Bank Nifty. FVG traders should use Bank Nifty for swing trades using the monthly contract (Lot size: **30 units**).
*   **Taxation Reality:** As per Union Budget 2025, Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) are taxed at **20%**. Additionally, STT on options selling is **0.1%** of the premium. This high cost means capturing small 10-point FVGs is no longer profitable. You need to target larger FVGs on higher timeframes (15-minute or 1-hour charts) to ensure your net profit covers the increased transaction costs.

### FVG Strategy for Nifty 50 (Intraday)
1.  **Timeframe:** Use the 15-minute chart to identify the FVG and the 5-minute chart for entry.
2.  **Identify the Trend:** Ensure Nifty is making higher highs (for bullish FVG).
3.  **Mark the Zone:** Draw a rectangle extending the FVG into the future.
4.  **Wait for Mitigation:** Do not chase the price. Wait for Nifty to drop back into the box.
5.  **Entry Trigger:** Enter a Long position when a green candle closes inside or just bouncing off the FVG zone.
6.  **Stop Loss:** Place your SL just below the low of Candle 1 (the candle before the imbalance).

| Feature | Nifty 50 Strategy | Bank Nifty Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contract Type** | Weekly Options (Thu Expiry) | Monthly Options (Last Wed) |
| **Lot Size (Nov '25)** | 75 Units | 30 Units |
| **Timeframe** | 5 min / 15 min | 1 Hour / 4 Hour |
| **Target FVG Size** | 20-40 Points | 100-150 Points |
| **Holding Period** | Intraday | 2-5 Days (Swing) |

## Benefits and Limitations of FVG

No strategy is foolproof. Understanding the pros and cons helps you manage expectations and risk.

### The Advantages
*   **Objective Definition:** Unlike trendlines which can be subjective, an FVG is mathematically defined by the high/low of specific candles. It is either there, or it isn't.
*   **High Risk-Reward Ratio:** By entering at the FVG (the origin of the move), your stop loss is tight (just below the setup candle). This often yields R:R ratios of 1:3 or higher.
*   **Institutional Footprint:** You are trading with the "Smart Money" flow rather than trying to predict it. You are essentially piggybacking on the orders of large DIIs and FIIs.

### The Limitations
*   **Not All Gaps Fill:** In extremely strong trends (like a runaway gap), price may not return to the FVG immediately. Waiting for a fill can result in missed opportunities.
*   **False Signals:** During low liquidity periods (like 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM in Indian markets), price may drift through an FVG without respecting it.
*   **News Impact:** High-impact news (like RBI policy announcements) can invalidate technical zones. An FVG acts as a magnet, but a surprise rate hike can smash through it instantly.

## Practical Example: Reliance Industries

Let's visualize a swing trade scenario on a heavyweight stock like Reliance Industries (RIL).

**Scenario:**
Reliance is trading at ₹2,800. It announces a partnership deal, and the price shoots up to ₹2,860 in a single hour.

*   **Candle 1 (10:00 AM):** High is ₹2,810.
*   **Candle 2 (11:00 AM):** Large green candle, price moves from ₹2,812 to ₹2,850.
*   **Candle 3 (12:00 PM):** Low is ₹2,825.

**The Analysis:**
There is a gap between Candle 1 High (₹2,810) and Candle 3 Low (₹2,825). The FVG zone is **₹2,810 – ₹2,825** (a ₹15 gap).

**The Trade:**
Instead of buying at ₹2,860 (FOMO), a smart trader sets a limit buy order at ₹2,820 (inside the gap). Two days later, the hype settles, and Reliance retraces to ₹2,815, filling the orders, before bouncing back to ₹2,900. The trader entered at a discount, while retail traders who bought at ₹2,860 are trapped in drawdown.

## Understanding Risk Factors

Trading FVGs involves significant market risk, especially in the derivatives segment. You must be aware of the financial implications.

### Volatility and Stop Hunts
Market makers often push prices slightly beyond an FVG to trigger stop losses before reversing. This is called a "Stop Hunt." To counter this, avoid placing your stop loss exactly at the edge of the FVG. Give it a buffer of 0.5% to 1% depending on the asset's volatility (Beta).

### The Cost of Trading
With the **STT on options at 0.1%** and **STCG tax at 20%** (for AY 2026-27), your break-even point is higher than before.

*   **Example Calculation:** If you buy a Nifty lot (75 qty) at ₹100 premium and sell at ₹110, your gross profit is ₹750.
*   **Costs:** Brokerage (approx ₹40) + STT (0.1% of turnover) + Exchange Charges + GST + Stamp Duty.
*   **Net Reality:** Transaction costs can eat up 10-15% of small profits. Ensure your FVG strategy targets moves large enough to absorb these costs.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Three-Candle Rule:** Always look for the gap between Candle 1 and Candle 3. No gap means no FVG.
*   **Wait for the Pullback:** FVG is a retracement strategy. Patience is your edge; do not chase the initial impulse move.
*   **Check the Trend:** Only trade Bullish FVGs in an uptrend and Bearish FVGs in a downtrend. Counter-trend FVGs have a higher failure rate.
*   **Mind the Regulations:** Focus intraday strategies on Nifty 50 (weekly expiry). Use Bank Nifty for swing trades due to monthly-only contracts.
*   **Verify Lot Sizes:** As of November 2025, trade 75 units for Nifty and 30 units for Bank Nifty. Incorrect position sizing leads to margin errors.
*   **Tax Awareness:** Factor in 20% STCG and higher STT when calculating your risk-reward ratio.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Observation & Identification**
*   Do not trade. Open charts of Nifty 50 and top 5 stocks (HDFC Bank, Reliance, Infosys, ICICI, TCS).
*   Mark 10 FVGs every day on the 1-hour chart.
*   Track how many "filled" (price returned to the zone) and how many "held" (price bounced from the zone).

**Month 2: Paper Trading**
*   Start paper trading on Nifty 50 using the 15-minute timeframe.
*   Define your entry (start of FVG), stop loss (below Candle 1), and target (recent high).
*   Calculate the theoretical P&L including 0.1% STT and brokerage charges to see if the strategy is net profitable.

**Month 3: Live Execution**
*   Start with one lot of Nifty 50 (75 units).
*   Limit yourself to one trade per day during high-liquidity hours (9:30 AM – 11:00 AM).
*   Journal every trade, specifically noting if the FVG was fully filled or partially filled before the reversal.

## FAQs on Fair Value Gap (FVG)

### What is the success rate of FVG trading?
While no strategy guarantees 100% success, FVG setups typically offer a high probability when aligned with the dominant trend. Success rates vary by market conditions, but combining FVG with other indicators like RSI or Order Blocks can significantly improve accuracy.

### Can I use FVG for intraday trading in Bank Nifty?
Yes, but with caution. Since Bank Nifty weekly expiries were discontinued in November 2024, liquidity is concentrated in monthly contracts. This results in wider bid-ask spreads, making quick scalping harder. It is better suited for intraday swing moves (1-2 hours) rather than minute-based scalping.

### How does FVG differ from a normal price gap?
A normal gap (like a gap-up opening) is a visible empty space on the chart where no trading occurred. An FVG happens *during* continuous trading and is visible as a candle structure where wicks don't overlap. FVG is a liquidity imbalance, not just a price jump.

### Which timeframe is best for FVG trading?
It depends on your style. Scalpers use 1-minute or 5-minute charts for Nifty. Swing traders prefer 1-hour or 4-hour charts for stocks. The 15-minute chart is widely considered the "Goldilocks" timeframe for intraday F&O trading in Indian markets.

### Do all Fair Value Gaps get filled?
No. While price often returns to rebalance the gap, it is not guaranteed. In strong momentum trends (like a budget day rally), price may leave an FVG behind and never revisit it for weeks. Always use a stop loss; never trade on the assumption that the gap *must* fill.
