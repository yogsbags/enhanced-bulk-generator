## Summary
This article covers the foundational concepts of India's two primary stock market indices: Sensex and Nifty. We analyze their distinct roles, composition (30 vs 50 stocks), and the critical structural changes effective in FY 2025-26, including the revised lot sizes (75 for Nifty, 20 for Sensex) and the synchronization of weekly expiries to Tuesdays. The guide explains how these indices function as economic barometers and provides a roadmap for investors to participate via Index Funds or ETFs.

If you have ever watched a business news channel, you have heard the phrases "Sensex is up" or "Nifty is down." But what exactly are these numbers, and why do they dictate the mood of the entire nation? At their core, Sensex and Nifty are the pulse of the Indian economy—scorecards that tell you how the largest companies in India are performing. For a beginner, understanding **what is Sensex and Nifty** is the first step toward financial literacy. For the active trader, keeping up with their changing derivatives rules (like the recent discontinuation of Bank Nifty weekly contracts) is a survival requirement.

## What Are Sensex and Nifty?

Think of the stock market as a giant supermarket with thousands of products (companies). Checking the price of every single product to see if inflation is up is impossible. Instead, you check the price of a "basket" of essential items. If the basket costs more, you know inflation is up.

Sensex and Nifty are those baskets for the Indian stock market.

### The Sensex (Sensitive Index)

*   **Exchange:** Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Asia's oldest stock exchange.
*   **Launched:** 1986.
*   **Composition:** Top 30 largest, most financially sound companies listed on BSE.
*   **Base Year:** 1978-79 (Base Value = 100).
*   **Calculation:** Free-float market capitalization method.

When the Sensex crosses a milestone (like 80,000 or 85,000), it signals that the collective value of these 30 giants has grown relative to the base year.

### The Nifty 50 (National Stock Exchange Fifty)

*   **Exchange:** National Stock Exchange (NSE), India's largest exchange by volume.
*   **Launched:** 1996.
*   **Composition:** Top 50 most liquid and large-cap stocks listed on NSE.
*   **Base Year:** 1995 (Base Value = 1,000).
*   **Calculation:** Free-float market capitalization method.

The Nifty 50 is broader than the Sensex, covering 13 sectors of the economy. Because it includes more companies and sees higher trading volumes, it is the primary benchmark for most mutual funds and foreign investors.

## Key Differences: Sensex vs. Nifty

While both indices often move in the same direction, their structural differences matter significantly, especially for traders in November 2025.

| Feature | Nifty 50 | Sensex |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exchange** | NSE (National Stock Exchange) | BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) |
| **Number of Stocks** | 50 | 30 |
| **Derivatives Lot Size** | **75 units** (As of Nov 2025)* | **20 units** (As of Nov 2025)* |
| **Weekly Expiry Day** | **Tuesday** | **Tuesday** (Shifted Jan 2025) |
| **Sector Representation** | Broader (13+ sectors) | Concentrated (Heavy financials) |
| **Liquidity** | Higher (Preferred for F&O) | High (Growing in derivatives) |

*   *Data Source: NSE and BSE circulars effective Nov 20, 2024. Subject to periodic review by exchanges.*

### The "Tuesday Clash" in 2025

A major change for traders in 2025 is the expiry schedule. Previously, Sensex weekly contracts expired on Fridays. As per BSE circulars effective January 1, 2025, Sensex weekly expiry shifted to **Tuesday**. Since Nifty 50 weekly expiry is also Tuesday, traders now face a "Super Tuesday" with both major indices expiring on the same day. This has consolidated liquidity but increased intraday volatility on Tuesdays.

## How Are They Calculated?

Both indices use the **Free-Float Market Capitalization** method. This sounds technical, but the concept is simple.

1.  **Market Cap:** Total Value = Share Price × Total Shares.
2.  **Free Float:** We only count shares available for public trading (excluding shares held by promoters/governments).
3.  **Weightage:** Companies with higher free-float market cap get a higher weight in the index.

**Example:**
If HDFC Bank has a weight of 13% in Nifty, a 1% rise in HDFC Bank's stock price will move the Nifty much more than a 5% rise in a smaller company like Tata Consumer (which might have <1% weight).

> "The beauty of free-float methodology is that it reflects what is actually tradable, preventing promoters with large holdings from artificially skewing the index value."

## Why Do Sensex and Nifty Matter?

Even if you don't trade stocks, these indices impact your financial life.

### 1. The Economic Barometer
When the economy is growing, corporate earnings rise, and stock prices go up, pushing the indices higher. A crashing Nifty often signals economic distress, prompting the RBI or government to intervene with policy changes.

### 2. Mutual Fund Benchmarking
Most equity mutual funds compare their performance against Nifty or Sensex. If your Large Cap fund gave 12% returns while Nifty gave 15%, your fund "underperformed" the market. In FY 2025-26, passive funds tracking these indices have gained popularity precisely because beating the Nifty has become harder for active managers.

### 3. Portfolio Valuation
Your Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs), National Pension System (NPS) equity tier, and EPF equity portion are all directly or indirectly invested in Nifty/Sensex stocks. When the indices rise, your retirement corpus grows.

## How to Invest in Sensex and Nifty

You cannot buy the "Index" directly like a stock. However, you have two primary ways to participate:

### Option 1: Passive Investing (Safe & Recommended)
This involves buying a basket that mimics the index.
*   **Index Mutual Funds:** You invest cash, and the fund manager buys all 50 Nifty stocks in the exact same proportion. Minimum investment can be as low as ₹500.
*   **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds):** These trade like stocks on the exchange. You need a Demat account to buy Nifty Bees or Sensex ETFs. Expense ratios are extremely low (often 0.05% or less).

### Option 2: Derivatives Trading (High Risk)
Traders buy Futures and Options (F&O) contracts based on the index value. This is where the **November 2025** regulations are critical.

*   **Increased Lot Sizes:** As per SEBI mandates to curb retail speculation, the contract value was raised. A single Nifty lot is now **75 units** (up from 25 previously). If Nifty is at 24,000, the contract value is ₹18 Lakh. You pay a margin (approx. ₹1.5 - ₹2 Lakh) to trade one lot.
*   **Discontinued Contracts:** Note that **Bank Nifty weekly contracts were discontinued** in November 2024. Only monthly and quarterly contracts exist for Bank Nifty now. For weekly trading action, volumes have shifted primarily to Nifty 50 and Sensex (both Tuesday expiry).

## Understanding Risk Factors

Before you invest or trade, understand what moves these needles.

### Concentration Risk
Both indices are top-heavy. As of late 2024, the Financial Services sector alone accounts for over 30% of the Nifty's weight. If the banking sector faces a crisis, the entire index drags down, even if IT or Auto sectors are doing well.

### Volatility (VIX)
The "India VIX" measures expected volatility. In 2025, with both major weekly expiries on Tuesday, intraday swings of 200-300 points on Nifty are not uncommon. For F&O traders, this means stop-losses can be hit faster.

### Global Correlation
Indian indices don't move in isolation. If the US markets (Dow Jones/Nasdaq) crash overnight, Sensex and Nifty typically open with a "gap down" the next morning. In FY 2025-26, correlations with Asian markets like Nikkei and Hang Seng have also strengthened.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Definitions:** Sensex (30 stocks, BSE) and Nifty 50 (50 stocks, NSE) are India's benchmark indices.
*   **Current Lot Sizes (Nov 2025):** Nifty 50 is **75 units**; Sensex is **20 units**. This increases the minimum capital required for F&O trading.
*   **Expiry Schedule:** Both Nifty and Sensex weekly contracts now expire on **Tuesdays**. Bank Nifty weekly contracts are **discontinued**.
*   **Investment Route:** Beginners should use Index Funds or ETFs for long-term wealth creation. F&O is for experienced traders with sufficient capital.
*   **Performance:** These indices reflect the health of India's largest companies and are used to benchmark mutual fund performance.

## Action Plan

*   **Month 1: Assess & Open**
    *   Check your existing portfolio. Do you own Nifty/Sensex stocks directly or via funds?
    *   Open a Demat account if you don't have one to access ETFs.
*   **Month 2: Start SIPs**
    *   Start a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in a Nifty 50 Index Fund. Even ₹1,000/month builds a diversified core portfolio.
    *   Avoid lump-sum investments if the market is at an all-time high; stagger your entry.
*   **Month 3: Advanced Learning (Optional)**
    *   If interested in trading, learn about "Open Interest" and "Option Greeks" before touching F&O.
    *   Paper trade on Tuesday expiries to understand the volatility without risking real capital.

## Conclusion

Understanding **what is Sensex and Nifty** unlocks the ability to read the market's language. Whether you are a passive investor building a retirement corpus via ETFs or an active trader navigating the new Tuesday expiry landscape, these indices are your primary tools. In FY 2025-26, with higher lot sizes and streamlined expiries, the market demands more discipline than ever. Don't just watch the numbers scroll on the screen—make them work for you.
