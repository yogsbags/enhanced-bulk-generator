## Summary
This article covers the essentials of the NASDAQ stock market for Indian investors, analyzing its structure, key indices, and relevance in FY 2025-26. We examine current investment routes including the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), GIFT City opportunities, and mutual funds, alongside the updated taxation rules effective from July 2024. The analysis reveals how tech-heavy US exposure can diversify an Indian portfolio, despite currency risks and regulatory caps.

For many Indian investors, "NASDAQ" is synonymous with global technology dominance. It is the electronic marketplace where giants like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA trade. But for a smart investor in India, understanding **what is NASDAQ** goes beyond just brand names—it involves navigating currency fluctuations, tax implications, and specific regulatory channels like the LRS. As of November 2025, with the Nasdaq 100 hovering around the 24,800 level, the allure of US tech remains strong, but the rules of engagement have evolved.

## What is NASDAQ? Understanding the Exchange vs. the Index

When people ask "What is NASDAQ?", they are usually referring to one of two things: the stock exchange itself or the index that tracks it. It is crucial to distinguish between them.

### 1. The Exchange (Nasdaq Stock Market)
Founded in 1971, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) was the world's first electronic stock market. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which has a physical trading floor, NASDAQ is entirely digital. It is known for listing high-growth companies, particularly in technology, biotechnology, and clean energy sectors.

### 2. The Indices
For an Indian investor, the "market" is usually represented by two main indices:
*   **Nasdaq Composite:** Includes almost all stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange (over 3,000 companies). It gives a broad view of the tech and growth sector.
*   **Nasdaq-100:** This is the index most Indians invest in. It tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on NASDAQ. It includes the "Magnificent Seven" (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, Tesla) which drive a significant portion of global market returns.

### Key Characteristics
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Technology, Consumer Services, Health Care (No Financials in Nasdaq-100) |
| **Trading Hours (IST)** | 8:00 PM to 2:30 AM (Standard Time, Nov–Mar)* |
| **Volatility** | Typically higher than the S&P 500 or Dow Jones due to tech concentration |
| **Market Cap** | Home to the world's largest companies by valuation |

*Note: Trading hours shift to 7:00 PM – 1:30 AM IST during US Daylight Saving Time (March to November).*

## Why Indian Investors Look West

Investing in NASDAQ offers two distinct layers of returns for an Indian investor: **Asset Growth** and **Currency Appreciation**.

### The Currency Hedge
Historically, the Indian Rupee (INR) has depreciated against the US Dollar (USD) by approximately 3-5% annually over long periods. When you invest in US stocks:
*   If the stock goes up 10% and the USD rises 4% against INR, your net return in Rupee terms is roughly 14%.
*   Even if the stock stays flat, a rising dollar can add to your portfolio value.

### Sector Diversification
While the Nifty 50 is heavy on financials (banks/NBFCs) and energy, the Nasdaq-100 is dominated by technology and innovation. Adding NASDAQ exposure provides a hedge against domestic cyclical risks. For instance, while Indian markets might react to monsoon data, US tech stocks move on AI adoption and global enterprise spending.

## How to Invest in NASDAQ from India (November 2025 Status)

As of FY 2025-26, Indian investors have three primary routes to access US markets. Each has specific regulatory limits and tax structures.

### Route 1: Direct Investment via LRS
You can open a US brokerage account through platforms like Vested, INDmoney, or traditional brokers. This falls under the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) **Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)**.

*   **Limit:** USD 250,000 (approx. ₹2.1 crore) per financial year per individual.
*   **Process:** You transfer INR from your Indian bank to the US broker. The bank converts it to USD.
*   **Cost:** Banks typically charge a forex markup (0.5% to 2%) on the transfer.
*   **TCS (Tax Collected at Source):** As per current norms (November 2025), a 20% TCS applies on remittances exceeding ₹7 lakh in a financial year. This is not an extra cost but an advance tax you can claim as a refund when filing your ITR.

### Route 2: Mutual Funds and ETFs
This is the simplest route for most retail investors. You buy an Indian Mutual Fund (Fund of Funds) that invests in NASDAQ ETFs overseas.

*   **Current Status (Nov 2025):** The industry-wide limit of USD 7 billion for overseas investments has caused intermittent stoppages. However, SEBI recently permitted mutual funds to invest in overseas funds that have limited Indian exposure (under 25%).
*   **Availability:** Investors must check if specific schemes (like Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 FoF or Kotak Nasdaq 100 FoF) are accepting fresh lump sums or SIPs. Often, ETFs trading on NSE/BSE are available even if FoF inflows are paused, but they may trade at a premium to their NAV.

### Route 3: GIFT City (The New Frontier)
GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) offers a new channel. NSE International Exchange (NSE IFSC) allows Indians to buy US stocks under the LRS route but through a domestic setup.
*   **Advantage:** Transactions are often smoother, and some fractional ownership options are available.
*   **Emerging Option:** New "outbound" funds launched in GIFT City (like PPFAS GIFT City funds) allow investment via LRS without hitting the SEBI mutual fund cap.

## Taxation for Indian Investors (FY 2025-26)

Tax rules for foreign investments underwent a significant overhaul in the July 2024 Budget. As of November 2025, here is how you are taxed.

### Capital Gains Tax

| Investment Type | Holding Period | Tax Rate (FY 2025-26) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct US Stocks** | < 24 Months (Short Term) | Taxed at your Slab Rate |
| **Direct US Stocks** | > 24 Months (Long Term) | **12.5%** (No indexation) |
| **International MFs** | < 24 Months (Short Term) | Taxed at your Slab Rate |
| **International MFs** | > 24 Months (Long Term) | **12.5%** (No indexation) |

**Important Change:** Previously (April 2023 – July 2024), international mutual funds were taxed at slab rates regardless of holding period. The 2024 Budget restored the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) benefit, reducing the rate to 12.5% for holdings over 24 months. This makes international funds attractive again for long-term wealth creation.

### Dividend Taxation
*   **In the US:** A flat **25%** tax is withheld on dividends paid to Indian residents (as per the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement/DTAA).
*   **In India:** You must declare this dividend income in your ITR. It is taxed at your slab rate. However, you can claim the 25% tax paid in the US as a **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)** to avoid double taxation.

## Understanding Risk Factors

Investing in NASDAQ is not a one-way street to profit. You must consider these risks:

### 1. Currency Risk (The Double-Edged Sword)
While a rising dollar helps, a strengthening Rupee hurts. If the NASDAQ rises 5% but the Rupee appreciates 5% against the Dollar (rare, but possible), your net return is zero.

### 2. Concentration Risk
The Nasdaq-100 is heavily skewed towards technology. A regulatory crackdown on Big Tech in the US or a slowdown in AI spending can drag the entire index down, unlike a diversified index like the S&P 500.

### 3. Valuation Concerns
US tech stocks often trade at high Price-to-Earnings (PE) multiples. As of late 2025, with the index at record highs, valuations factor in aggressive future growth. Any earnings miss can lead to sharp corrections.

## Key Takeaways
*   **NASDAQ vs. NYSE:** NASDAQ is the digital exchange home to tech giants; NYSE is the traditional auction market.
*   **Two Indices:** Focus on **Nasdaq-100** for concentrated tech exposure; use **Nasdaq Composite** for broader market view.
*   **Tax Relief:** LTCG on foreign assets is now **12.5%** (holding > 24 months), a major improvement over the previous slab-rate regime.
*   **LRS Limits:** You can remit up to **$250,000/year**. Be aware of the **20% TCS** on amounts above ₹7 lakh (adjustable against tax liability).
*   **Diversification:** Use NASDAQ to hedge against INR depreciation and domestic market cycles, but limit exposure to 10-15% of your portfolio.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Preparation & KYC**
*   Check if your existing broker offers US investing or open an account with a specialized platform (Vested/INDmoney).
*   If preferring mutual funds, check the current status of Nasdaq 100 FoFs (open/closed) or look for ETFs on NSE.
*   Complete your KYC for LRS if investing directly.

**Month 2: Initial Allocation**
*   Start small. Allocate 5% of your investable surplus to US equities.
*   If using LRS, transfer a lump sum to minimize fixed swift transfer fees (transferring ₹5,000 is expensive; ₹50,000+ is efficient).

**Month 3: Review & SIP**
*   Set up a systematic transfer or manual monthly investment.
*   Monitor the USD-INR rate. Avoid aggressive buying if the Rupee has crashed sharply in a short span.

**Month 4-6: Tax Planning**
*   Keep track of dividend withholding.
*   Ensure you file **Form 67** before your ITR to claim the Foreign Tax Credit for US dividends.

## Conclusion

Investing in NASDAQ allows you to own a slice of the global innovation engine. With the favorable shift in taxation rules in FY 2025-26 and multiple access routes like LRS and GIFT City, the barriers to entry have lowered. However, the combination of currency volatility and sector concentration demands a disciplined approach. Treat NASDAQ exposure as a strategic diversifier, not a get-rich-quick scheme.
