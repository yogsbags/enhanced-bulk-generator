## Summary

This article covers the fundamentals of debentures, a critical fixed-income instrument for Indian investors seeking alternatives to Fixed Deposits (FDs). We analyze the structural difference between Convertible and Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs), with a specific focus on the updated taxation rules for FY 2025-26. The analysis reveals that listed debentures now offer a distinct tax advantage for high-tax-bracket investors, with Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) taxed at 12.5% after 12 months, unlike FDs which are taxed at slab rates. We also examine credit ratings, liquidity risks, and the practical steps to invest via the secondary market or public issues.

Debentures are essentially loans you extend to a corporation. Unlike shareholders who own a piece of the company, debenture holders are creditors entitled to fixed interest payments (coupons) and principal repayment upon maturity. While they carry higher risk than bank FDs, they typically offer superior yields—often 1-3% higher than comparable government securities. This guide breaks down the mechanics, risks, and regulatory framework you need to navigate the Indian corporate bond market effectively.

## What are Debentures?

Think of a debenture as a formal IOU issued by a company. When a corporation needs funds for expansion or working capital but doesn't want to dilute equity (sell shares), it borrows money from the public by issuing debentures. In return, the company promises to pay you a fixed interest rate (coupon) at regular intervals and return your principal amount at the end of the tenure.

### The Core Components

*   **Principal (Face Value):** The amount you invest. In India, the face value is typically ₹1,000 or ₹10,000 per unit for retail issues.
*   **Coupon Rate:** The interest rate the company pays you. For example, if you hold a debenture with a ₹1,000 face value and an 8% coupon, you receive ₹80 annually.
*   **Tenure:** The lifespan of the bond. Corporate debentures in India usually range from 3 to 10 years.
*   **Credit Rating:** A grade assigned by agencies like CRISIL, ICRA, or CARE indicating the issuer's ability to repay. AAA is the safest, while ratings below BBB- are considered speculative (junk).

Unlike stocks, debentures do not give you voting rights. You are a lender, not an owner. However, in the event of liquidation, debenture holders have a higher claim on assets than equity shareholders.

## Types of Debentures in India

Understanding the variety of debentures is crucial for aligning investments with your risk appetite. In the Indian market, these instruments are primarily categorized by convertibility and security.

### 1. Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs)
These are the most common type available to retail investors. As the name suggests, NCDs cannot be converted into company shares. To compensate for this lack of equity upside, NCDs offer higher interest rates. They are pure fixed-income instruments listed on stock exchanges (BSE/NSE), providing liquidity before maturity.

### 2. Convertible Debentures
These instruments give you the option to convert your debt into equity shares after a specific period. They come in two flavors:
*   **Fully Convertible Debentures (FCDs):** The entire principal is converted into equity shares. You effectively switch from being a lender to an owner.
*   **Partly Convertible Debentures (PCDs):** A portion of your investment is converted into shares, while the rest remains as debt and is repaid at maturity.

### 3. Secured vs. Unsecured
*   **Secured Debentures:** Backed by specific company assets (collateral). If the company goes bankrupt, these assets are sold to repay you. Most public NCD issues in India are secured.
*   **Unsecured Debentures:** Backed only by the issuer's creditworthiness. They carry higher risk and, consequently, offer higher coupon rates.

## How Debentures Work: A Practical Example

Let's look at a real-world scenario to understand the cash flow. Suppose you invest in the **Axis Bank NCD** (hypothetical example based on November 2025 market rates).

**Investment Details:**
*   **Issuer:** Axis Bank
*   **Face Value:** ₹1,000 per unit
*   **Investment Amount:** ₹1,00,000 (100 units)
*   **Coupon:** 7.27% p.a.
*   **Tenure:** 10 Years
*   **Payout:** Annual

**Cash Flow Timeline:**
1.  **Year 0 (Nov 2025):** You pay ₹1,00,000 to buy the debentures.
2.  **Year 1 to 9:** You receive ₹7,270 (7.27% of ₹1L) every year as interest income.
3.  **Year 10 (Maturity):** You receive the final interest of ₹7,270 + your principal of ₹1,00,000 back.

**Total Earnings:** Over 10 years, you earn ₹72,700 in interest plus your capital back. If you had sold the debentures on the exchange in Year 5 when interest rates fell, the price of your bond might have risen to ₹1,050, giving you a capital gain in addition to interest.

## Taxation of Debentures (FY 2025-26 Update)

The taxation landscape for debentures shifted significantly with the Finance Act 2024. It is critical to distinguish between **Listed** and **Unlisted** debentures, as the rules now differ drastically.

### 1. Interest Income (TDS Rules)
Interest earned from debentures is fully taxable at your income tax slab rate. This applies to both listed and unlisted debentures.
*   **TDS Applicability:** As per Section 193 of the Income Tax Act, companies must deduct **10% TDS** if the interest paid to a resident individual exceeds **₹5,000** in a financial year.
*   **Note:** If your total income is below the taxable limit, you can submit Form 15G/15H to avoid TDS.

### 2. Capital Gains Tax (The Game Changer)
This is where listed debentures score over Fixed Deposits.

| Feature | Listed Debentures | Unlisted Debentures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Holding Period (LTCG)** | More than 12 months | Not Applicable |
| **LTCG Tax Rate** | **12.5%** (No Indexation) | Taxed at Slab Rate |
| **STCG Tax Rate** | Slab Rate (held ≤ 12 months) | Slab Rate (Always) |

**Key Insight:** As per Finance Act 2024 (effective July 23, 2024), if you sell listed debentures after holding them for just 12 months, your gains are taxed at a flat 12.5%. For an investor in the 30% tax bracket, this is a massive saving compared to FDs or unlisted bonds, where gains are taxed at 30%.

*   **Unlisted Debentures Rule:** As per Finance Act 2023 and 2024 amendments, unlisted debentures are deemed short-term capital assets regardless of holding period. Gains are always added to your income and taxed at slab rates.

## Risks You Must Know

While debentures are safer than stocks, they are not risk-free like FDs (which have DICGC insurance up to ₹5 lakh).

### 1. Credit Risk (Default Risk)
The biggest risk is the company defaulting on interest or principal. Always check the credit rating. AAA is safest; AA is safe. Avoid anything below A unless you are an expert.
*   *Example:* An investor in DHFL NCDs faced significant losses when the company defaulted, despite high initial ratings.

### 2. Interest Rate Risk
Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions. If RBI raises rates, the price of your existing lower-coupon debentures will fall on the secondary market. This only matters if you sell before maturity.

### 3. Liquidity Risk
While NCDs are listed on BSE/NSE, trading volumes can be thin for some issues. You might not find a buyer immediately if you need to sell in an emergency. Sticking to high-rated, popular issuances (like Tata Capital, L&T Finance, HDFC) usually ensures better liquidity.

## Debentures vs. Fixed Deposits: A Quick Comparison

| Parameter | Corporate NCD (AAA Rated) | Bank Fixed Deposit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Returns (Nov 2025)** | ~7.2% - 7.8% | ~6.5% - 7.2% |
| **Safety** | Depends on Issuer (Check Rating) | High (DICGC Insured up to ₹5L) |
| **Liquidity** | Tradable on Exchange | Premature withdrawal (with penalty) |
| **Taxation (Interest)** | Slab Rate | Slab Rate |
| **Taxation (Gains)** | **12.5% LTCG** (if listed & >12m) | Always Slab Rate |

**Verdict:** For investors in the 20% or 30% tax bracket, listed NCDs offer better post-tax returns due to the 12.5% LTCG rate on secondary market sales, provided you understand the credit risk.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Structure:** Debentures are debt instruments where you lend money to a company for fixed interest returns.
*   **Tax Advantage:** Listed NCDs held for over 12 months attract only 12.5% LTCG tax, unlike FDs which are taxed at slab rates.
*   **TDS Rule:** Expect a 10% TDS deduction if your annual interest income from a single company exceeds ₹5,000.
*   **Safety First:** Stick to AAA or AA+ rated issuers. Higher interest rates usually signal higher risk.
*   **Liquidity:** Ensure you have a Demat account to trade NCDs on the secondary market if you need early exit.
*   **Unlisted Caution:** Avoid unlisted debentures if you seek tax efficiency, as they are taxed at slab rates regardless of holding period.

## Action Plan

*   **Month 1: Assessment & Account Setup**
    *   Check your asset allocation. Ideally, fixed income should be 20-40% of your portfolio depending on age.
    *   Open a Demat account if you don't have one (mandatory for listed NCDs).
    *   Review current NCD public issues on the NSE/BSE websites.

*   **Month 2: Selection & Investment**
    *   Filter for AAA-rated NCDs. Compare yields (YTM) with current FD rates.
    *   Invest a small tranche (e.g., ₹10,000 - ₹50,000) to understand the process.
    *   Set up a calendar reminder for interest payment dates.

*   **Month 3: Monitoring**
    *   Track the price of your NCD in your Demat holding.
    *   Re-evaluate if interest rates in the economy are rising or falling to decide whether to hold till maturity or sell.

## Conclusion

Debentures bridge the gap between the safety of FDs and the volatility of stocks. In FY 2025-26, they are particularly attractive for high-income investors due to the 12.5% LTCG tax regime for listed securities. However, the golden rule remains: return of capital is more important than return on capital. Always prioritize credit rating over a slightly higher coupon rate. By diversifying across high-quality corporate NCDs, you can build a robust passive income stream that beats inflation.

## FAQs on Debentures

### What is the difference between NCD and FD?
The main difference lies in risk and taxation. FDs are issued by banks and insured up to ₹5 lakh, while NCDs are issued by companies and carry credit risk. Tax-wise, listed NCDs offer a 12.5% LTCG rate after 12 months, whereas FD interest is always taxed at your slab rate.

### Is TDS applicable on NCD interest?
Yes, as per Section 193, 10% TDS is deducted if the annual interest payout to a resident individual exceeds ₹5,000. This applies to listed debentures. You can submit Form 15G/15H if your total income is below the taxable limit to avoid this deduction.

### Can I sell my debentures before maturity?
Yes, if they are listed NCDs. You can sell them on stock exchanges (NSE/BSE) just like shares through your Demat account. However, liquidity depends on market demand, and you might have to sell at a lower price if interest rates have risen.

### What happens if the company defaults?
If a company defaults, secured debenture holders have a first claim on the specific assets pledged as collateral. Unsecured debenture holders are treated as general creditors. This is why checking the credit rating (AAA/AA) is non-negotiable before investing.

### How are capital gains on debentures calculated?
For listed debentures held over 12 months, gains are Long-Term (LTCG) and taxed at 12.5% without indexation. If held for 12 months or less, gains are Short-Term (STCG) and taxed at your income tax slab rate. Unlisted debentures are always taxed at slab rates.
