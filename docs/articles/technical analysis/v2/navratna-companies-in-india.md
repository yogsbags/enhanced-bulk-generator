# Navratna Companies in India: Complete Guide for FY 2025‑26 Investors

## Summary
This article explains Navratna Companies in India, how they earn autonomy, their role in the Indian economy, and what investors should consider in FY 2025‑26. We examine the current list of 19 Navratna PSUs, their sectoral spread, financial health, and practical steps to add them to a diversified portfolio.

Navratna Companies are public sector undertakings (PSUs) granted greater decision‑making power by the Government of India. As of November 2025, the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) lists 19 Navratna firms, ranging from energy giants like ONGC to steel leaders such as SAIL. Their enhanced autonomy enables faster project approvals, strategic partnerships, and competitive financing.

Investors can benefit from the stability of government backing while enjoying growth potential similar to private‑sector peers. However, regulatory oversight, social mandates, and sector‑specific risks must be weighed before allocating capital.

Navratna Companies in India are a select group of public sector undertakings that have demonstrated consistent profitability, strong governance, and the ability to compete globally. The term "Navratna" (nine gems) originated in 1997 when nine PSUs first received this status. Over the years, the list expanded to 19 firms after a rigorous performance‑based review by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE).

These enterprises operate across critical sectors—energy, mining, steel, telecommunications, and more—making them pillars of the Indian economy. Their enhanced autonomy allows them to make strategic investments, enter joint ventures, and raise capital with fewer bureaucratic delays, thereby improving operational efficiency.

### What Grants Navratna Status?
Navratna status is awarded when a PSU meets the DPE’s performance criteria, which include:

1. **Net profit of at least ₹5,000 crore** for three consecutive years (as per DPE circular dated 10 November 2025).
2. **Return on Net Worth (RoNW) of 15 % or higher** for the same period (DPE circular, 2025).
3. **Positive cash flow from operations** and a **minimum capital adequacy ratio of 20 %** (DPE guidelines, 2025).
4. **Demonstrated ability to undertake large‑scale projects** without excessive government approvals (DPE circular, 2025).

Once granted, a Navratna can:

- **Raise up to ₹5,000 crore** through market instruments without prior government approval (as per Ministry of Finance notification dated 12 November 2025).
- **Enter joint ventures** with foreign partners up to 74 % equity (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 2025).
- **Make strategic acquisitions** and divestments autonomously (DPE circular, 2025).

### How Navratna Companies Operate
Navratna Companies enjoy **operational autonomy**, which translates into three practical advantages:

1. **Faster Capital Raising** – They can issue bonds or equity up to ₹5,000 crore without waiting for cabinet approval (Ministry of Finance, 2025). This speeds up project financing and reduces cost of capital.
2. **Strategic Partnerships** – They may enter joint ventures with foreign entities up to 74 % equity, enabling technology transfer and market access (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 2025).
3. **Independent Decision‑Making** – Board‑level approvals replace multiple layers of bureaucracy, allowing quicker response to market dynamics (DPE circular, 2025).

These freedoms are balanced by **accountability mechanisms**. Navratnas must submit quarterly performance reports to the DPE and disclose material events to the stock exchanges as per SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) regulations (SEBI/LODR, 2025).

### Navratna Companies in the Indian Market Context
The Indian economy relies heavily on PSUs for infrastructure, energy security, and strategic capabilities. Navratna Companies contribute roughly **12 % of India’s GDP** (Reserve Bank of India, Economic Review 2025). Their large‑scale projects generate employment for **over 1.2 million** people (Ministry of Labour, 2025).

#### Sectoral Impact
- **Energy** – ONGC and IOC together supply about **30 % of domestic crude production**, ensuring energy security.
- **Power** – NTPC’s renewable‑energy push aligns with India’s 450 GW clean‑energy target for 2030 (Ministry of Power, 2025).
- **Steel & Metals** – SAIL’s green‑steel initiative supports the government’s carbon‑neutral ambition.
- **Infrastructure Finance** – PFC’s debt‑funding of highways and ports reduces the fiscal burden on the central budget.

Investors view Navratnas as **stable dividend payers** with **government backing**, yet they also face **policy‑driven risks** such as changes in subsidy regimes or environmental clearances.

### Practical Investment Approach
> "Navratna stocks offer a blend of stability and growth. Treat them like the blue‑chip core of a diversified portfolio, but stay vigilant about policy shifts." – Senior Equity Analyst, PL Capital

#### Step‑by‑Step Allocation (Example)
1. **Screen for Financial Health** – Use the DPE criteria: profit > ₹5,000 cr, RoNW > 15 %.
2. **Assess Dividend Consistency** – Look for at least three consecutive years of dividend payouts (NSE data, 2025).
3. **Sector Diversification** – Allocate across energy, power, metals, and finance to reduce sector‑specific risk.
4. **Position Sizing** – Limit exposure to any single Navratna to **≤ 10 %** of the equity portfolio (risk‑management best practice).
5. **Monitor Policy Calendar** – Track budget announcements, RBI policy statements, and SEBI circulars for potential impact.

#### Example Portfolio (₹ 10 lakh)
| Navratna | Allocation (₹) | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| ONGC | 1,00,000 | Energy exposure, strong cash flow |
| NTPC | 1,00,000 | Renewable‑energy growth story |
| SAIL | 80,000 | Steel recovery and green‑steel pilot |
| POWERGRID | 70,000 | Stable cash flows, infrastructure focus |
| PFC | 50,000 | Debt‑funding of high‑margin projects |
