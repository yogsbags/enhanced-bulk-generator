## Summary
This article dissects **DuPont Analysis**, a framework that helps you look beyond the simple Return on Equity (ROE) number. We analyze how it breaks profitability into three critical drivers: operating efficiency, asset use, and financial leverage. The guide explains the 3-step and 5-step models with real-world Indian sector examples, helping you distinguish between high-quality wealth creators and risky, debt-fueled companies in FY 2025-26.

Imagine two companies: Company A and Company B. Both report a Return on Equity (ROE) of 20%. On the surface, they look identical. You might even split your capital equally between them. But dig deeper, and you find Company A is a cash-generating machine selling products fast, while Company B is barely breaking even and fueling that 20% return purely by taking on massive debt.

One is a wealth creator; the other is a ticking time bomb. A simple ROE calculation hides this difference. **DuPont Analysis** reveals it.

## What is DuPont Analysis?

DuPont Analysis is a diagnostic framework that breaks down Return on Equity (ROE) into its core components. Instead of just asking *"How much return did the company generate?"*, it asks *"How did the company generate that return?"*

Developed by the DuPont Corporation in the 1920s, this model remains one of the most powerful tools for fundamental investors in India. It transforms ROE from a single static number into a story about a company's strategy and health.

### The Core Formula
At its heart, the DuPont model argues that a company's return to shareholders comes from three distinct sources:
1.  **Profitability**: How much profit it keeps from every rupee of sales.
2.  **Efficiency**: How fast it turns assets into sales.
3.  **Leverage**: How much debt it uses to fund operations.

Mathematically, it expands the ROE formula:

**Standard ROE** = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity

**DuPont ROE** = (Net Profit Margin) × (Asset Turnover) × (Financial Leverage)

## The Three Pillars of Return

To truly understand a business, you must analyze which of these three pillars is doing the heavy lifting. Let's break them down with an Indian market context.

### 1. Net Profit Margin (Operating Efficiency)
This measures pricing power and cost control. It answers: *"For every ₹100 of sales, how many rupees end up as profit?"*

*   **Formula**: Net Income ÷ Revenue
*   **Indian Context**: IT giants like TCS or Infosys typically command high margins (20%+) because they sell services with low raw material costs. In contrast, a retail chain like Avenue Supermarts (DMart) operates on razor-thin margins (4-6%) but makes up for it elsewhere.

### 2. Asset Turnover Ratio (Asset Use Efficiency)
This measures speed. It answers: *"How many rupees of sales does the company generate for every rupee of assets it owns?"*

*   **Formula**: Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets
*   **Indian Context**: This is the secret weapon of the FMCG and Retail sectors. A company like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) might have an asset turnover of 2.0x or higher, meaning it generates ₹2 in sales for every ₹1 of assets. Infrastructure companies, burdened with heavy machinery and land, often struggle to cross 0.5x.

### 3. Financial Leverage (The Risk Factor)
This measures how much the company relies on debt. It answers: *"How many rupees of assets does the company control for every rupee of equity?"*

*   **Formula**: Average Total Assets ÷ Average Shareholder's Equity
*   **The Double-Edged Sword**: Leverage acts as a multiplier. If a company borrows money at 8% and invests it to earn 15%, shareholders win big (ROE zooms up). But if the business earns only 5%, leverage destroys shareholder value. A high ROE driven *only* by this factor is a major red flag.

## 3-Step vs. 5-Step DuPont Model

While the 3-step model is great for a quick check, the **5-step DuPont Analysis** offers a forensic deep dive. It further breaks down the "Net Profit Margin" to isolate the impact of interest payments and taxes.

This is particularly relevant in FY 2025-26, where corporate tax rates (typically 25% plus surcharge for most domestic companies) and varying interest rates can distort comparisons.

### The 5-Step Components
1.  **Tax Burden**: (Net Income ÷ EBT). A higher number means a lower tax rate (keeping more profit).
2.  **Interest Burden**: (EBT ÷ EBIT). A number close to 1.0 means the company has little debt cost. A low number (e.g., 0.4) means interest is eating up profits.
3.  **Operating Margin**: (EBIT ÷ Revenue). The core profitability from operations.
4.  **Asset Turnover**: (Revenue ÷ Assets).
5.  **Financial Leverage**: (Assets ÷ Equity).

**Why use the 5-step?** It tells you if a drop in ROE is due to bad business operations (Operating Margin) or just higher tax/interest costs (external factors).

## Sector Wars: DuPont in Action

Let's apply this to the Indian market. Different sectors rely on different DuPont levers to generate their ROE. Here is a comparison of typical profiles you might see in FY 2025-26.

| Component | **FMCG Sector** (e.g., HUL, Nestle) | **Banking/NBFC** (e.g., Bajaj Finance) | **Infrastructure** (e.g., L&T, Adani Ent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Driver** | **Asset Turnover** | **Financial Leverage** | **Asset Heavy / Leverage** |
| **Net Margin** | Moderate (15-20%) | Moderate (varies) | Low (5-10%) |
| **Asset Turnover** | **High (> 2.0x)** | Low (< 0.2x)* | Low (< 0.8x) |
| **Leverage** | Low (Equity funded) | **Very High (6-8x)** | High (Debt funded) |
| **Result** | High Quality ROE | High ROE (Riskier) | Volatile ROE |

*Note: Banks naturally have low asset turnover because their "assets" are loans, and "sales" is interest income. DuPont analysis for banks requires specialized interpretation.*

## Step-by-Step Calculation Example

Let's evaluate a hypothetical company, **"Bharat Motors Ltd,"** based on its FY 2025-26 financial data.

**The Data:**
*   **Revenue**: ₹10,000 Crore
*   **Net Income**: ₹1,500 Crore
*   **Average Total Assets**: ₹5,000 Crore
*   **Shareholder's Equity**: ₹2,500 Crore

**Step 1: Calculate Standard ROE**
$$ROE = \frac{1,500}{2,500} = 60\%$$
*Result: An incredible 60% ROE. But is it safe?*

**Step 2: Apply DuPont Decomposition**

1.  **Net Profit Margin**: ₹1,500 / ₹10,000 = **15%** (Healthy margins)
2.  **Asset Turnover**: ₹10,000 / ₹5,000 = **2.0x** (Excellent efficiency)
3.  **Financial Leverage**: ₹5,000 / ₹2,500 = **2.0x** (Moderate leverage)

**Calculation:**
$$15\% \times 2.0 \times 2.0 = 60\%$$

**Analysis**: Bharat Motors is generating this high ROE through a balance of good margins and high efficiency, with only moderate debt. This is a **high-quality ROE**.

**Contrast this with "Risky Infra Ltd":**
*   Margin: 5%
*   Turnover: 0.5x
*   Leverage: **8.0x**
*   ROE: $5\% \times 0.5 \times 8.0 = 20\%$

Here, the 20% ROE is entirely dependent on dangerous leverage levels. One bad quarter could wipe out equity.

## Red Flags: When DuPont Screams "Sell"

Using DuPont Analysis can save you from value traps. Watch out for these warning signs in your portfolio:

*   **Rising ROE, Falling Margins**: If ROE is going up but Net Profit Margin is going down, the company is likely loading up on debt (increasing leverage) to mask operational inefficiency.
*   **The "Empty" Turnover**: High asset turnover is good, but not if it comes from slashing prices so deeply that margins vanish. You want *profitable* speed, not just speed.
*   **Declining Interest Burden**: In the 5-step model, if the Interest Burden ratio is dropping year after year (e.g., from 0.8 to 0.5), the company is working harder just to pay its lenders. This is a classic solvency crisis in the making.

## Key Takeaways

*   **ROE is not enough**: A high ROE can be a sign of efficiency OR a sign of excessive risk. You must check the source.
*   **Know the Sector**: Don't compare an IT company's turnover with a Retail company's. Compare peers within the same industry.
*   **Leverage is the wild card**: High leverage boosts ROE in good times but crushes it in bad times. Prefer companies where ROE is driven by Margins and Turnover.
*   **Trend is friend**: Look at the 3-year trend of DuPont components. Is the company becoming more efficient (Turnover rising) or just more indebted (Leverage rising)?
*   **Tax matters**: Use the 5-step model to see if changes in corporate tax rates (like the Section 115BAA 25% regime) are the only reason for an ROE bump.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Portfolio Audit**
*   Take your top 5 stock holdings.
*   Calculate their 3-step DuPont metrics for FY 2024-25.
*   Identify which pillar (Margin, Turnover, Leverage) is the primary driver of their ROE.

**Month 2: Peer Comparison**
*   Compare your holdings against their toughest competitor.
*   Example: Compare your Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) holding against Infosys. Who has better margins? Who uses assets better?

**Month 3: Risk Filtering**
*   Filter out any company in your watchlist where Financial Leverage is the *sole* reason for high ROE (>20%).
*   Replace them with companies showing improving Asset Turnover or expanding Margins.

## Conclusion

DuPont Analysis gives you X-ray vision for your portfolio. It separates the luck from the skill and the risky bets from the sustainable compounders. In the Indian market, where debt-heavy companies often trap retail investors, this framework is your first line of defense. Don't just buy ROE; buy the *quality* of that ROE.

## FAQs on DuPont Analysis

### What is a good Asset Turnover Ratio in India?
It depends entirely on the sector. For capital-intensive sectors like Power or Infrastructure, a ratio of 0.5x to 0.8x is typical. For retail companies (like DMart or Trent), investors typically look for a ratio above 2.5x. Always compare a company against its direct industry peers rather than a universal benchmark.

### Can DuPont Analysis be applied to banks?
Yes, but with caution. Banks naturally have very high financial leverage (often 8x-10x) because customer deposits are treated as liabilities. Standard turnover ratios also don't apply well. For banks, analysts often modify the model to focus more on Return on Assets (ROA) and Net Interest Margins (NIM).

### How does the 5-step model differ from the 3-step model?
The 3-step model groups all costs into "Net Profit Margin." The 5-step model breaks this margin down further to show the specific impact of **Interest expenses** and **Taxes**. This helps you see if a company's lower profitability is due to operational issues, high debt costs, or an unfavorable tax structure.

### Why is Financial Leverage considered a risk in DuPont Analysis?
Leverage artificially inflates ROE. If a company borrows heavily to buy assets, its equity base remains small, pushing the ROE calculation up. However, this increases bankruptcy risk. DuPont Analysis highlights this by showing exactly how much of the ROE comes from "Equity Multiplier" (debt) versus actual operational efficiency.

### Where can I find the data for DuPont Analysis?
You can find all necessary figures—Net Income, Revenue, Assets, and Equity—in a company's Annual Report or quarterly results on the BSE/NSE websites. Most financial screening websites also provide these raw numbers. Ensure you use "Consolidated" financial statements for a complete picture of large conglomerates.
