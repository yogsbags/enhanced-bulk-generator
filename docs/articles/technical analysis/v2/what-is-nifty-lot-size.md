## Summary
This article covers the critical changes to **Nifty lot sizes** effective November 2025, following NSE's latest circulars. We analyze the new lot size of **65 units** for Nifty 50, the revised **30 units** for Bank Nifty, and the impact of SEBI's "one weekly index" rule. The guide explains how these changes affect your margin requirements (approx. ₹1.8-2.0 lakh per lot), the new ₹15-20 lakh contract value mandates, and the updated STT rates for FY 2025-26.

In the high-stakes world of derivatives trading, the **lot size** is your entry ticket. It defines the minimum quantity of shares you can buy or sell in a single contract. As of November 2025, the landscape has shifted significantly. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has revised the **Nifty 50 lot size to 65 units** (down from 75) to align with SEBI's mandate of keeping contract values between ₹15 lakh and ₹20 lakh. For traders, this isn't just a number—it changes your capital requirements, risk exposure, and profit calculations.

## Understanding Nifty Lot Size

### What is Nifty Lot Size?
A **lot size** represents the standardized quantity of the underlying asset (in this case, the Nifty 50 index) contained in one derivative contract. You cannot trade 1 or 10 units of Nifty; you must trade in multiples of the defined lot size.

Think of it like buying eggs. You don't buy them individually; you buy a carton (lot) of 6 or 12. In F&O trading, the exchange fixes this "carton size" to ensure liquidity and maintain a minimum contract value.

### The Mechanics of Contract Value
SEBI regulates lot sizes to control risk. If the lot size is too small, retail investors with low capital might take excessive leverage. If it's too large, liquidity dries up.

As per SEBI's master circular (updated Oct 2024), the **contract value** for index derivatives must fall within the **₹15 lakh to ₹20 lakh** band at the time of review.

**The Formula:**
> Contract Value = Lot Size × Current Index Price

**Example Calculation (November 2025):**
*   **Nifty 50 Spot Price:** Assuming ₹26,500
*   **Current Lot Size:** 65 units
*   **Contract Value:** 65 × ₹26,500 = **₹17,22,500**

This value sits perfectly within the ₹15-20 lakh regulatory band. If Nifty rallies to ₹32,000, the contract value would breach ₹20 lakh, prompting NSE to reduce the lot size further (e.g., to 60 or 50) in the next review cycle.

## Current Nifty & Bank Nifty Lot Sizes (November 2025)

Following the NSE circular (Ref: NSE/FAOP/70616 dated Oct 2025), lot sizes were revised effective October 28, 2025. Here is the current status for all major indices.

| Index | Symbol | Current Lot Size (Nov 2025) | Previous Lot Size (Early 2025) | Expiry Schedule | Contract Value (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nifty 50** | NIFTY | **65** | 75 | Weekly (Tue) & Monthly | ₹17.2 Lakhs |
| **Bank Nifty** | BANKNIFTY | **30** | 35 | Monthly Only* | ₹16.5 Lakhs |
| **Fin Nifty** | FINNIFTY | **60** | 65 | Monthly Only* | ₹16.8 Lakhs |
| **Midcap Select** | MIDCPNIFTY | **120** | 140 | Monthly Only* | ₹15.5 Lakhs |
| **Nifty Next 50** | NIFTYNXT50 | **25** | 25 | Monthly Only* | ₹18.0 Lakhs |

*Data Source: NSE Circulars effective October 28, 2025. Note: Contract values fluctuate with market price.*

**Important Notes:**
*   **Weekly Expiry Update:** As per SEBI's risk management framework (effective Nov 20, 2024), exchanges can offer weekly expiries for **only one benchmark index**. NSE selected **Nifty 50** (Tuesdays). Bank Nifty and Fin Nifty now have **only monthly contracts** (expiring last Tuesday of the month).
*   **Transition Phase:** If you held long-dated quarterly contracts created before Oct 2025, they may still carry the old lot size (75) until expiry. Always check the specific contract details on your trading terminal.

## Financial Implications for Traders

### 1. Margin Requirements
With the contract value standardized around ₹15+ lakhs, the upfront margin required to trade one lot has increased compared to the pre-2024 era (when contract values were ~₹5-10 lakhs).

**Futures Margin Example (Nifty 50):**
*   **Contract Value:** ₹17,22,500
*   **Span + Exposure Margin:** Typically ~11-12% of contract value.
*   **Required Capital:** ~₹1,90,000 to ₹2,05,000 per lot.

*Implication:* You now need approximately **₹2 lakh** in your account to trade a single lot of Nifty Futures comfortably. This is a significant jump from the ₹1-1.2 lakh requirement seen in 2023.

### 2. Profit & Loss (P&L) Volatility
The lot size acts as a multiplier for your P&L. A smaller lot size (65 vs 75) means slightly *lower* P&L swings per point of index movement, but the higher index value offsets this.

*   **Movement:** Nifty moves up 100 points.
*   **Old Lot (75):** Profit = 100 × 75 = ₹7,500
*   **New Lot (65):** Profit = 100 × 65 = ₹6,500

While the per-lot profit is lower, the percentage return on capital remains similar because the margin requirement is adjusted proportionally to the contract value.

### 3. Transaction Costs (STT & Charges)
For FY 2025-26, transaction costs have risen due to the revised Securities Transaction Tax (STT).

*   **STT on Options (Sale):** **0.1%** of premium value (increased from 0.0625%).
*   **STT on Futures (Sale):** **0.02%** of contract value (increased from 0.0125%).

**Cost Impact Example (Option Sale):**
Selling 1 Lot Nifty Call @ ₹200 Premium.
*   **Premium Value:** 65 × 200 = ₹13,000
*   **STT (0.1%):** ₹13
*   **Exchange txn charges:** Flat fee or % (varies by broker/exchange).

While ₹13 sounds small, high-frequency traders engaging in thousands of lots face a substantial drag on net profitability.

## Why SEBI Changes Lot Sizes

You might wonder, "Why keep changing the lot size? Why not stick to 50?"

SEBI's primary goal is **risk containment** for retail investors.

1.  **Barrier to Entry:** By mandating a minimum contract value of ₹15 lakh, SEBI ensures that only traders with sufficient capital (₹2-5 lakh min portfolio) participate. This discourages small retail investors with ₹10,000-₹50,000 from speculating in high-risk derivatives.
2.  **Inflation Adjustment:** As the Nifty index rises (from 18,000 to 26,000+), a fixed lot size of 50 would make the contract value too high (₹13 lakh vs ₹20+ lakh). NSE adjusts the lot size downward (75 → 65) to keep the contract value within the manageable ₹15-20 lakh band.

## Understanding Risk Factors

Before trading the new lot sizes, consider these technical risks.

### Delta (Price Sensitivity)
With a lot size of 65, your "Portfolio Delta" for one ATM call option is approx 32.5 (0.50 delta × 65). This means for every 1 point Nifty rises, your option premium gains roughly ₹32.50. Understanding this multiplier is crucial for position sizing.

### Theta (Time Decay)
Time decay eats into option premiums daily. With higher STT and transaction costs in FY 2025-26, scalping for small 5-10 point moves is harder. You need larger moves to cover the spread + tax + theta decay.

### Liquidity Risk
While Nifty 50 (Weekly) remains highly liquid, the **discontinuation of weekly expiries** for Bank Nifty and Fin Nifty means liquidity is now concentrated in monthly contracts. Traders accustomed to "Zero-Hero" trades on Bank Nifty Wednesdays must now adjust to monthly expiry dynamics.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Current Limit:** Nifty 50 lot size is **65 units** (effective Oct 28, 2025). Bank Nifty is **30 units**.
*   **Capital Needed:** Expect to deploy **₹1.9 - ₹2.1 lakh** as margin for one futures lot.
*   **Expiry Rule:** Only **Nifty 50** has weekly expiry (Tuesdays). All other indices are monthly only.
*   **Tax Impact:** STT is now **0.1%** on options sale; factor this into your breakeven calculations.
*   **Contract Value:** Strictly maintained between **₹15 lakh and ₹20 lakh** to curb excessive retail speculation.
*   **Verification:** Always check the "Contract Info" on your trading terminal before placing orders, as old contracts may have different lot sizes.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Audit & Adjustment**
*   Check your trading terminal settings. Ensure your quantity presets match the new lot sizes (65 for Nifty, 30 for Bank Nifty).
*   Recalculate your position sizing. If you used to trade 4 lots (300 qty) of old Nifty (75), 4 lots is now 260 qty. Adjust to maintain your desired delta exposure.

**Month 2: Strategy Migration**
*   If you traded Bank Nifty Weeklies, migrate to **Nifty 50 Weekly** strategies or adapt to **Bank Nifty Monthly** cycles.
*   Test the liquidity in Bank Nifty monthly contracts during mid-month weeks.

**Month 3: Cost Optimization**
*   Review your P&L statements to see the impact of the 0.1% STT.
*   Consider moving from "Buying OTM Options" (low probability) to "Credit Spreads" (higher probability) to justify the higher transaction costs.

## Conclusion

The shift to a **65-unit lot size** for Nifty and the consolidation of weekly expiries mark a mature phase for Indian derivatives. These changes, driven by SEBI's ₹15-20 lakh contract value mandate, aim to protect retail capital while maintaining market depth. For the serious trader, the math has changed, but the opportunity remains. Success in FY 2025-26 requires adapting your capital allocation to these higher thresholds and respecting the increased transaction costs.
