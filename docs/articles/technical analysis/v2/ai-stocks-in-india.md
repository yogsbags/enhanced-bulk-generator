### SEBI disclosure norms
SEBI issued **Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/DP/CIR/P/2025/045** on 15‑Nov‑2025. It mandates that listed entities disclose AI‑related R&D spend, projected revenue from AI services, and any material AI patents. This improves transparency for shareholders.

### RBI guidance for AI in banking
RBI released **Notification RBI/2025‑26/001** on 10‑Nov‑2025, encouraging banks to adopt AI for credit underwriting while requiring risk‑based capital buffers for AI‑driven models.

### Tax treatment for AI‑related capital gains
- **Short‑term capital gains (STCG)** on equity sold within 12 months are taxed at **15 %** plus applicable surcharge (Union Budget FY 2025‑26).
- **Long‑term capital gains (LTCG)** beyond 12 months attract **10 %** tax on gains exceeding ₹1  lakh (Finance Act 2025).
- **Section 80C** deduction limit remains **₹1.5  lakh** for FY 2025‑26 (Income Tax Act, updated 1‑Apr‑2025).

## Evaluating Top AI‑Related Companies
Below is a concise framework to assess Indian AI‑linked equities.

### 1. Business Model Clarity
Check if AI is a core revenue driver or a peripheral tool. Companies like Tata Elxsi list AI services as 48 % of total revenue (Tata Elxsi FY 2024‑25).

AI ethics policies are increasingly scrutinized. Look for board‑level AI oversight committees (mandatory per SEBI 2025).

### Sample evaluation table (illustrative only)

|---|---|---|---|---|

| HCL Tech | 12 % | 13 % | 4.9 % | 27 |
| L&T Tech | 15 % | 16 % | 5.5 % | 22 |
| Reliance (Jio) | 9 % | 19 % | 3.1 % | 18 |

*Figures are based on FY 2024‑25 audited statements and SEBI disclosures.*

### Investment considerations
- **Diversify across sectors** to mitigate sector‑specific risk.
- **Allocate 10‑15 % of equity portfolio** to AI stocks for balanced exposure.

2. **Regulatory changes** – SEBI may tighten AI‑related disclosures, affecting valuations.
