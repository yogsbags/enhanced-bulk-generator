## Summary
This article analyzes the "Coffee Can Investing" strategy, a low-maintenance wealth creation approach adapted for Indian markets. We examine the core "10/15" screening criteria—consistent 10% revenue growth and 15% Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) over a decade. The guide explains how this buy-and-hold method minimizes transaction costs and taxes (LTCG at 12.5% for FY 2025-26) while leveraging the power of compounding. We also provide a step-by-step action plan for building your own portfolio.

Coffee Can Investing is the financial equivalent of planting a Banyan tree: you plant it once, ensure the soil is right, and then let it grow for decades without digging it up every week to check the roots. In the high-noise world of Indian stock markets, where algorithms trade in microseconds and news channels scream "Buy" or "Sell" every hour, this strategy offers a refreshing antidote. It is built on a simple premise: identifying high-quality companies and holding them for at least 10 years, regardless of market volatility.

## The Origin and Philosophy

### From the Wild West to Dalal Street
The term "Coffee Can Investing" was coined by Robert Kirby in 1984. He noticed a client who had inadvertently built a massive fortune not by trading, but by forgetting. The client had purchased stocks recommended by Kirby but, unlike other clients who sold them based on market timing, he simply kept the physical share certificates in a coffee can. Decades later, the portfolio had compounded into vast wealth because the winners (multi-baggers) massively offset the losers.

In India, this concept was popularized by Saurabh Mukherjea (formerly of Ambit Capital, now Marcellus Investment Managers). He adapted Kirby’s philosophy to the Indian context, realizing that in a developing economy, governance and capital efficiency are the primary drivers of long-term shareholder value.

### Why "Fill It, Shut It, Forget It" Works
The strategy solves three major problems that plague retail investors:
1.  **Behavioral Bias:** It prevents you from panic-selling during corrections (like the 2020 crash) or greed-buying during bubbles.
2.  **Transaction Costs:** By not trading, you save on brokerage, depository charges, and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), which is 0.1% on delivery trades.
3.  **Tax Efficiency:** You delay capital gains taxes for years, allowing your pre-tax money to compound. In FY 2025-26, this is crucial as the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax is 12.5%.

## The "10/15" Rule: Screening Criteria

How do you find companies worthy of a 10-year commitment? You don't guess; you look at the data. The Indian adaptation of this strategy relies on strict quantitative filters, often called the "10/15" rule.

### 1. Revenue Growth > 10%
The company must have delivered revenue growth of at least 10% **every single year** for the last 10 years.
*   **Why it matters:** In a high-inflation economy like India (typically 5-6%), a company growing at 10% is delivering real volume growth. Consistency is key here—one bad year breaks the streak.

### 2. ROCE > 15%
The company must maintain a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of at least 15% **every single year** for the last 10 years.
*   **Why it matters:** ROCE measures how efficiently a company uses its capital. A 15% ROCE covers the cost of capital (typically 12-13% in India) and leaves a surplus for reinvestment. This surplus is the fuel for compounding.

### 3. Market Capitalization Filter
While not a hard rule, most investors apply a minimum market cap filter (e.g., ₹100 Crore or ₹500 Crore) to ensure liquidity and data reliability.

| Metric | Requirement | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Min 10% (Year-on-Year) | Ensures demand for products/services is expanding faster than inflation. |
| **ROCE** | Min 15% (Pre-tax) | Ensures the business generates surplus cash to fund its own growth. |
| **Consistency** | 10 Years Non-negotiable | Filters out cyclical companies and "one-hit wonders." |

## The Mathematics of Wealth Creation

### The Power of Low Churn
Imagine two investors, Rahul and Priya. Both start with ₹10 Lakh.
*   **Rahul (Trader):** Churns his portfolio once a year. He pays brokerage and STT annually. More importantly, he pays taxes annually. As per Union Budget 2025, Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) are taxed at 20%.
*   **Priya (Coffee Can):** Buys and holds for 10 years. She pays zero tax until the end.

Even if both earn a 15% pre-tax return, Priya wins significantly. Why? Because Rahul's portfolio is taxed every year, interrupting the compounding process. Priya's tax liability is deferred to the end, meaning her "tax money" continues to earn returns for 10 years.

### Understanding the "Tail Risk"
Critics often ask, "What if a company goes bust?" This is a valid concern. In a typical Coffee Can portfolio of 10-15 stocks, history suggests:
*   **2-3 stocks** might fail or stagnate (lose value).
*   **5-7 stocks** will perform average (market returns).
*   **2-3 stocks** will be "blockbusters" (growing 20x, 50x, or 100x).

The math of equity is asymmetrical: the maximum you can lose is 100% (stock goes to zero), but the maximum you can gain is infinite. One stock going up 50x covers the losses of ten stocks going to zero. This is why you never rebalance a Coffee Can portfolio—you let the winners run.

## Tax Implications for FY 2025-26

Understanding the tax landscape is vital for long-term planning. As of November 2025, here is how your Coffee Can portfolio is taxed.

### Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)
*   **Applicability:** Stocks held for more than 12 months.
*   **Rate:** 12.5%.
*   **Exemption:** The first ₹1.25 Lakh of gains in a financial year are tax-free.
*   **Source:** As per Union Budget 2025 (effective July 2024).

### Dividend Taxation
*   **Treatment:** Dividends are added to your annual income and taxed as per your slab rate.
*   **TDS:** 10% TDS is deducted if dividend income exceeds ₹5,000 in a year.

### Strategic Advantage
Since Coffee Can Investing involves holding for 10+ years, you avoid the 20% STCG tax entirely. You only pay the 12.5% LTCG tax when you finally sell to fund a goal (like retirement or a child's education).

## Risks and Limitations

No strategy is foolproof. Here is what can go wrong.

### 1. Governance Fraud
The "10/15" rule looks at past data. It cannot detect if a promoter is currently cooking the books. Companies like Satyam or DHFL had great numbers right until they collapsed.
*   **Mitigation:** Diversify across 15-20 stocks. Never put more than 10% in one company.

### 2. Structural Disruption
A company might have dominated for 10 years, but technology can kill it in two. Think of Kodak or Nokia. In India, the shift to EVs could disrupt traditional auto ancillary players who passed the 10/15 filter in the past.
*   **Mitigation:** Review the portfolio annually (passive review) to check if the *business model* is still relevant, even if you don't sell.

### 3. Valuation Risk
Great companies often trade at expensive valuations (High P/E ratios). Buying a great company at a P/E of 100 might result in poor returns if the earnings growth slows down even slightly.
*   **Reality Check:** Coffee Can proponents argue that P/E contracts over time as earnings grow. However, entering at extreme valuations requires a holding period of 15-20 years to justify the price.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Patience Pays:** The strategy works best over 10+ years. It is not for those seeking quick listing gains.
*   **Strict Filters:** Stick to the 10% Revenue Growth and 15% ROCE rule. Do not dilute criteria for "promising" stories.
*   **Ignore Noise:** Market crashes, election results, and budget announcements are noise. The performance of the underlying business is the signal.
*   **Tax Efficiency:** You benefit from tax deferral. You only pay 12.5% LTCG (above ₹1.25 Lakh) at the very end.
*   **Asymmetry:** You need only a few massive winners to create wealth. Let your winners run; do not sell them to "book profits."

## Action Plan

Ready to build your Coffee Can? Follow this monthly roadmap.

**Month 1: The Cleanup**
*   Review your existing portfolio. Identify stocks that do not meet the 10/15 criteria.
*   If you have "junk" stocks (low ROCE, poor governance), consider exiting them to free up capital.
*   **Note:** Be mindful of STCG (20%) and LTCG (12.5%) implications before selling.

**Month 2: The Screener**
*   Use a stock screener tool. Set filters: Revenue Growth > 10% (YoY for 10 years) and ROCE > 15% (YoY for 10 years).
*   You will likely find a list of 15-25 companies. These are typically market leaders in paints, adhesives, banking, FMCG, and IT.

**Month 3: Allocation**
*   Select the top 10-15 companies from your list across different sectors (don't buy 5 banks).
*   Allocate an equal amount to each (e.g., ₹50,000 in each of 10 stocks).
*   If you don't have a lump sum, start a manual SIP. Buy these stocks monthly on a fixed date.

**Month 4 Onwards: The "Shut It" Phase**
*   Stop checking stock prices daily. Uninstall the trading app from your phone if needed.
*   Reinvest dividends received back into the same stocks.
*   Only sell if the fundamental business model breaks (not because the stock price fell).

## Conclusion

Coffee Can Investing is boring, and that is exactly why it is profitable. It removes the biggest enemy of wealth creation: you. By filtering for high-quality companies and refusing to interrupt the compounding process, you allow your capital to grow alongside India's best businesses.

## FAQs on Coffee Can Investing

### What is the minimum amount needed for Coffee Can Investing?
There is no regulatory minimum. However, to build a diversified portfolio of 10-15 high-quality stocks (some of which may have high share prices), a starting corpus of ₹1-2 Lakh is ideal. Alternatively, you can build it gradually via monthly investments.

### Can I use this strategy for small-cap stocks?
Yes, but it is riskier. The "Little Champs" variation of this strategy focuses on small-cap companies. However, the screening criteria (10% Revenue growth, 15% ROCE) remain strict to ensure you only pick small companies with clean accounts and dominant niches.

### When should I sell a Coffee Can stock?
You should sell only if the company's fundamentals permanently deteriorate (e.g., accounting fraud, loss of market leadership, or obsolescence of products). Do not sell due to temporary poor quarterly results or market corrections.

### How does the 12.5% LTCG tax affect this strategy?
The 12.5% tax applies only when you sell. Since you hold for 10+ years, you delay this tax liability. This deferral allows your money to compound pre-tax for a decade, which is mathematically superior to frequent trading where you pay taxes annually.

### Is this strategy suitable for retired individuals?
Generally, no. This is a wealth *creation* strategy requiring a 10-year horizon. Retirees typically need wealth *preservation* and regular income. A Coffee Can portfolio can be volatile in the short term, which is risky if you need to withdraw money for monthly expenses.
