## Summary
This article covers the essential components of an IPO prospectus, the definitive legal document that discloses a company's financial health, risks, and future plans before it goes public. We analyze the critical differences between a Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) and a Red Herring Prospectus (RHP), and explain how to scan these 400+ page documents efficiently. The guide also details the latest SEBI regulations for FY 2025-26, including the T+3 listing timeline and the new "Offer Document Summary" proposal, ensuring you make data-backed investment decisions.

An IPO prospectus is often dismissed as a boring legal formality. In reality, it is the only document standing between your capital and a potential wealth destroyer. While marketing campaigns sell you a dream, the prospectus is legally bound to tell you the truth. Whether you are a seasoned HNI or a first-time investor, understanding this document is non-negotiable for due diligence.

## The Lifecycle of an IPO Document

Before a company hits the stock exchanges, its offer document evolves through three distinct stages. Understanding this evolution helps you know *when* to look for information and *what* is still subject to change.

### 1. Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP)
This is the first draft filed with SEBI. It is a preliminary document that contains everything *except* the price band and the exact number of shares.
*   **Purpose:** To invite public comments and SEBI observations.
*   **Timing:** Filed 3-6 months before the IPO opens.
*   **Key Feature:** It allows you to spot early red flags before the hype machine begins.

### 2. Red Herring Prospectus (RHP)
Once SEBI gives its observations and the company updates the draft, it becomes the RHP. This is the version you will see when the IPO opens for subscription.
*   **Purpose:** The official invitation to investors.
*   **Timing:** Filed with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) at least 3 days before the issue opens.
*   **Key Feature:** It includes the **price band** (or the floor price) and the issue dates. It does *not* contain the final issue price or the specific number of shares (since these depend on demand).

### 3. The Final Prospectus
This document is filed *after* the IPO closes and shares are allotted.
*   **Purpose:** The final legal record.
*   **Timing:** Filed after the issue closes.
*   **Key Feature:** It contains the final **issue price** (the price at which shares were allotted) and the exact number of shares subscribed.

## Anatomy of a Prospectus: What Matters?

A typical prospectus runs into 400-600 pages. You do not need to read every word. Focus on these four critical sections that reveal the company's true character.

### 1. Objects of the Offer
This section answers the most important question: *"Why do they need my money?"*

| Usage of Funds | Verdict | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Capital Expenditure (Capex)** | ✅ Positive | Indicates growth (new plants, tech upgrades). |
| **Debt Repayment** | ⚠️ Neutral/Positive | Reduces interest burden, boosts future margins. |
| **General Corporate Purposes (GCP)** | ⚠️ Caution | Vague. SEBI caps this at 25% of the fresh issue. |
| **Offer for Sale (OFS)** | ❌ Negative/Neutral | Money goes to existing shareholders (exit), not the company. |

*   **Note:** As per SEBI ICDR (Amendment) Regulations 2025, for SME IPOs, the limit for General Corporate Purposes is strictly capped at 15% of the issue size or ₹10 crore, whichever is lower. This ensures funds are used for tangible business needs.

### 2. Risk Factors (The "Truth Serum")
This is often the most honest section of the document. Companies are legally required to list every possible thing that could go wrong.
*   **Internal Risks:** Look for heavy dependence on a single client (e.g., "Top 5 customers contribute 80% of revenue"), pending criminal litigation against promoters, or raw material concentration.
*   **External Risks:** Regulatory changes or industry cycles. These are generic and less critical than internal risks.

### 3. Financial Information
Do not just look at the profit figure. Dig deeper into the "Restated Financial Statements."
*   **Cash Flow:** Is the company generating positive Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)? A company can show profits on paper while bleeding cash.
*   **Margins:** Are EBITDA margins consistent, or did they spike suddenly in the year before the IPO (window dressing)?
*   **New Rule (2025):** Companies can now voluntarily disclose **Proforma Financial Statements** for recent acquisitions or divestments, even if they fall below the 20% materiality threshold. This gives you a clearer picture of the *current* business structure.

### 4. Legal and Other Information
Check for "Outstanding Litigation." A few tax disputes are normal. However, criminal cases against promoters or SEBI investigations are major red flags.

## How to Read a Prospectus: The PL Capital Strategy

Reading 500 pages is impossible for most retail investors. Use this 30-minute scanning strategy to extract 80% of the value.

### Step 1: The "Ctrl+F" Audit (5 Minutes)
Download the PDF and search for these keywords:
*   **"Related Party"**: Are they siphoning money to promoter-owned group companies?
*   **"Litigation"**: How many cases are pending?
*   **"Negative Cash Flow"**: Has the company burned cash in the last 3 years?

### Step 2: The Promoter Check (10 Minutes)
Go to the "Management" section.
*   Who are the promoters?
*   What is their experience?
*   **Salary Check:** Are they paying themselves excessive salaries while the company makes losses?

### Step 3: The Valuation Sanity Check (15 Minutes)
Go to the "Basis for Issue Price" section. Compare the company's P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings) with the "Industry Peers" listed in the table.
*   **Example:** If the company asks for a P/E of 80x while established peers trade at 40x, ask yourself: *"Is this premium justified by higher growth?"*

## The New Standard: Offer Document Summary

For years, investors relied on the "Abridged Prospectus"—a summarized version attached to the application form. However, things are changing in FY 2025-26.

As per SEBI's consultation paper (November 2025), the regulator is moving to replace the Abridged Prospectus with a standardized **"Offer Document Summary."**
*   **What it is:** A concise document focusing on the most critical information without legal jargon.
*   **Access:** You can access it via a **QR code** printed on the application form (mandatory for SME IPOs since March 2025).
*   **Benefit:** It allows you to view key financial ratios, object of the issue, and promoter details instantly on your mobile device.

## The Application Process: November 2025 Update

Once you have analyzed the prospectus and decided to invest, the execution is digital and fast.

### 1. UPI Limits
As of November 2025, the transaction limit for retail investors applying via UPI is **₹5 lakh**. This covers almost all retail applications (since the retail quota limit is ₹2 lakh) and even small HNI applications.

### 2. Mandatory T+3 Listing
The timeline between IPO closing and listing has been permanently compressed to **T+3 days** (Trade date + 3 days).
*   **Impact:** Your blocked funds are released faster if you don't get an allotment, improving your liquidity.

### 3. ASBA (Application Supported by Blocked Amount)
Money does not leave your bank account when you apply. It is merely "blocked." It is debited only if you receive an allotment. This ensures you continue to earn savings interest on your funds until the allotment date.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Start with the DRHP:** Use the Draft Prospectus to evaluate the company months before the hype builds up.
*   **Check the Usage:** Prefer companies using funds for Capex or debt reduction over those where promoters are just selling their stake (OFS).
*   **Scan for Risks:** Use "Ctrl+F" to find related party transactions and pending litigations.
*   **Valuation Matters:** Compare the P/E ratio in the "Basis for Issue Price" section with listed peers.
*   **Know the Timeline:** Listing now happens in T+3 days, and UPI limits are ₹5 lakh.
*   **Tax Implications:** Remember that listing gains (STCG) are taxed at **20%**, and long-term gains (>1 year) are taxed at **12.5%** (above ₹1.25 lakh exemption).

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Build Your Framework**
*   Download the RHP of a recently listed company (e.g., from the NSE website).
*   Practice the "30-minute scan" strategy: identify the Objects, Top 3 Risk Factors, and Promoter Salary.

**Month 2: Live Application**
*   Identify an upcoming IPO.
*   Read the "Offer Document Summary" or Abridged Prospectus.
*   Apply using ASBA/UPI through your PL Capital account if the fundamentals align with your goals.

**Month 3: Post-Listing Review**
*   Compare the prospectus promises with the first quarterly result post-listing.
*   Did they use the funds as stated? If not, consider exiting.

## Conclusion

The prospectus is not just a compliance requirement; it is your primary defense against bad investments. By learning to navigate the DRHP and RHP, you move from speculating on hype to investing on facts. In a market where listing gains are taxed at 20%, capital preservation is as important as appreciation. Due diligence is the rent you pay for financial success.

## FAQ Section

### What is the main difference between DRHP and RHP?
The DRHP is a draft filed with SEBI for review and does not contain the price band or issue dates. The RHP is the final version filed with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) before the IPO opens, containing the price band and updated financial data.

### Where can I download the IPO prospectus?
You can download the DRHP and RHP for free from the SEBI website (sebi.gov.in) under the "Offer Documents" section, the websites of the stock exchanges (NSE/BSE), or the merchant banker's website managing the issue.

### What are the tax rules for IPO listing gains in 2025?
As of November 2025, listing gains sold within 12 months are classified as Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) and taxed at **20%**. Gains held for more than 12 months are Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) taxed at **12.5%** (for gains exceeding ₹1.25 lakh/year).

### What is the "Objects of the Issue" section?
This section details how the company plans to use the money raised. It is critical to check if funds are for growth (Capex), stability (debt repayment), or vague purposes (General Corporate Purposes). Avoid companies where the majority of the issue is an Offer for Sale (OFS).

### Can I apply for more than ₹2 lakh in an IPO?
Yes, but not as a Retail Individual Investor (RII). Applications above ₹2 lakh fall under the Non-Institutional Investor (NII) or HNI category. The UPI limit for IPO applications is ₹5 lakh, making it easy to apply for small HNI quotas via UPI.
