## Summary

This article covers the critical updates to **Nifty lot size** and F&O regulations effective November 2025. We analyze the shift to higher lot sizes (Nifty at 75, Bank Nifty at 30) driven by SEBI's new ₹15 Lakh minimum contract value rule. The guide explains the discontinuation of Bank Nifty weekly contracts, the revised Tuesday/Thursday expiry schedule, and the impact of increased STT rates (0.1% on options) on your trading capital. You will find a complete breakdown of current lot sizes for all major indices, including Sensex and FinNifty, along with a strategic action plan for adapting to these high-value contracts.

In the high-stakes world of Indian derivatives, \"lot size\" isn't just a number—it's the gatekeeper of your capital. If you traded F&O in 2023, you might remember buying a Nifty contract for roughly ₹5-7 lakhs in notional value. Fast forward to November 2025, and the game has changed entirely. With SEBI's mandate to curb retail speculation, the entry barrier has tripled. Today, understanding **what is Nifty lot size** means grappling with a minimum contract value of ₹15 lakhs. This shift doesn't just affect how much margin you need; it fundamentally alters your risk management, position sizing, and profit potential.

## What is Lot Size in Options Trading?

In the derivatives market, you cannot buy or sell indices like Nifty 50 or individual stocks in single units. You must trade them in bundles, known as **lots**. The **lot size** is the fixed number of units contained in one contract.

Think of it like buying eggs. You generally don't buy a single egg; you buy a carton of 6 or 12. Similarly, on the NSE, you buy a \"carton\" of Nifty units.

For November 2025, the **Nifty 50 lot size is 75 units**. This means if you buy 1 lot of Nifty Futures at 24,000, you are effectively controlling a position worth:

**24,000 (Index Price) × 75 (Lot Size) = ₹18,00,000 (Contract Value)**

This is significantly higher than the ₹5-10 lakh contract values seen in previous years. The lot size acts as a multiplier for your profits and losses. A 100-point move in Nifty doesn't mean you make ₹100; it means you make ₹7,500 (100 × 75).

### Current Lot Sizes (November 2025)

| Index | Current Lot Size | Contract Value (Approx)* | Weekly Expiry Status |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Nifty 50** | **75** | ₹18 - 20 Lakhs | **Active (Tuesday)** |
| **Bank Nifty** | **30** | ₹15 - 16 Lakhs | **Discontinued** |
| **FinNifty** | **65** | ₹15 - 17 Lakhs | **Discontinued** |
| **Sensex** | **20** | ₹16 - 18 Lakhs | **Active (Thursday)** |
| **Midcap Select**| **120**| ₹15 Lakhs+ | **Discontinued** |

*Note: Contract values fluctuate with market price. Bank Nifty and other indices now only have **Monthly** contracts as per SEBI's \"One Exchange, One Weekly\" rule implemented in late 2024.*

## How are Lot Sizes Fixed for Options and Futures?

The determination of lot size is not arbitrary. It is strictly governed by SEBI guidelines to ensure that derivative contracts remain suitable for serious traders rather than small retail speculators. As of November 2025, the golden rule is the **₹15 Lakh Threshold**.

### The ₹15 Lakh - ₹20 Lakh Rule
SEBI mandates that the notional value of any derivative contract (Futures or Options) must fall within the range of **₹15 Lakhs to ₹20 Lakhs** at the time of review.

## How are Lot Sizes Fixed for Options and Futures?

The determination of lot size is not arbitrary. It is strictly governed by SEBI guidelines to ensure that derivative contracts remain suitable for serious traders rather than small retail speculators. As of November 2025, the golden rule is the **₹15 Lakh Threshold**.

### The ₹15 Lakh - ₹20 Lakh Rule
SEBI mandates that the notional value of any derivative contract (Futures or Options) must fall within the range of **₹15 Lakhs to ₹20 Lakhs** at the time of review.

**The Calculation Formula:**
$$ \text{Lot Size} = \frac{\text{Target Contract Value (₹15,00,000)}}{\text{Current Index Price}} $$

**Example Calculation:**
If Nifty is trading at 24,000:
$$ \text{Ideal Lot Size} = \frac{15,00,000}{24,000} = 62.5 $$

Since lot sizes are usually rounded to convenient numbers (multiples of 5 or 10), NSE fixes it at **65** or **75** to stay safely above the ₹15 Lakh floor. This is why you saw the Nifty lot jump from 25 to 75 in late 2024—to catch up with the new regulatory minimum.

### Stock F&O Lot Sizes
For individual stocks (like Reliance, HDFC Bank), the same logic applies. If a stock price doubles, its lot size is usually halved during the next review to keep the contract value near ₹15-20 Lakhs. This ensures that trading Reliance Futures requires roughly the same capital as trading SBI Futures, maintaining uniformity across the market.

## Why are Lot Sizes Modified?

Lot sizes are dynamic. NSE and SEBI review them periodically (typically semi-annually) to adjust for market movements.

### 1. Market Rally Adjustment
If the Nifty 50 index rallies from 24,000 to 30,000, the contract value of a 75-unit lot would swell to ₹22.5 Lakhs (30,000 × 75). This exceeds the ₹20 Lakh upper band. To bring it back in line, NSE would **reduce** the lot size (e.g., from 75 to 50 or 65).

* **Real-World Impact**: In November 2025, NSE announced a reduction of Nifty lot size to **65** effective for contracts expiring after December 2025. This is a direct response to the index appreciating in value.

### 2. Market Correction Adjustment
Conversely, if the market crashes by 30%, the contract value might drop below ₹15 Lakhs. In this scenario, NSE would **increase** the lot size to ensure the contract value stays above the regulatory minimum.

### 3. Regulatory Overhaul
The most significant modification occurred in late 2024, when SEBI raised the minimum contract value from ₹5 Lakhs to ₹15 Lakhs. This was a structural change designed to:
*   **Discourage small retail participation**: Higher contract values mean higher margin requirements (approx. ₹2-3 Lakhs for one Futures lot), filtering out traders with insufficient capital.
*   **Reduce market volatility**: Fewer speculative small players can lead to more stable price discovery.

## Purpose of Lot Size

Why does the stock market insist on lot sizes instead of allowing you to buy 1 unit of Nifty? The purpose is threefold:

### 1. Standardization
Lot sizes create a standard unit of trade. This makes liquidity management easier for market makers and institutions. When everyone trades in multiples of 75, matching buy and sell orders becomes highly efficient.

### 2. Risk Barrier (The "Safety Valve")
This is the most critical function in the Indian context. Derivatives are leveraged instruments. By enforcing a minimum contract value of ₹15 Lakhs, regulators ensure that a trader needs significant capital (margin) to enter the game.
*   **Margin Requirement**: To buy 1 lot of Nifty Futures (Value ₹18L), you typically need ~12-15% margin, which is **₹2.2 - ₹2.7 Lakhs**.
*   If lot sizes were small (e.g., 1 unit worth ₹24,000), a trader could enter with just ₹3,000 margin. This low barrier would attract inexperienced investors to high-risk products, leading to massive systemic risk.

### 3. Cost Efficiency
For institutional investors hedging portfolios worth crores, trading in small units would be tedious and costly due to transaction overheads. Large lot sizes allow them to hedge massive exposure with fewer contracts.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Current Nifty Lot**: As of November 2025, one lot of Nifty 50 is **75 units**. This applies to all active weekly and monthly contracts.
*   **Bank Nifty Change**: Bank Nifty lot size is **30 units**. Crucially, **weekly contracts are discontinued**; you can only trade monthly Bank Nifty options (Tuesday expiry).
*   **High Entry Barrier**: The minimum contract value is now **₹15 Lakhs**. Expect to deploy at least ₹2.5 Lakhs in margin for a single Futures lot, or pay higher premiums for Options.
*   **Sensex Option**: BSE Sensex lot size is **20 units** with a **Thursday weekly expiry**. This is now the only alternative to Nifty for weekly index trading.
*   **Tax Alert**: Remember that STT on options selling is now **0.1%** (up from 0.0625%), significantly increasing the breakeven point for scalpers.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Audit & Adjustment**
*   **Check Margins**: Log in to your PL Capital account and verify if you have adequate surplus cash. With the lot size at 75, your margin requirement for Nifty Futures is likely ₹2.5L+ per lot.
*   **Stop Weekly Bank Nifty Trades**: Remove Bank Nifty Weekly watchlists. They no longer exist. Shift focus to Nifty 50 (Tue) or Sensex (Thu) for weekly opportunities.

**Month 2: Strategy Recalibration**
*   **Adjust Position Sizing**: If you used to trade 4 lots of Nifty (old size 50 = 200 units), trading 4 lots now (new size 75 = 300 units) increases your exposure by 50%. Scale down to 2 or 3 lots to maintain similar risk.
*   **Test Sensex Liquidity**: With Bank Nifty weeklies gone, liquidity has shifted to Sensex. execute small trades (1 lot = 20 units) on Thursday expiries to get a feel for the premiums and volatility.

**Month 3: Advanced Risk Management**
*   **Hedge Overnight**: With contract values at ₹18L+, an overnight gap of 1% is a ₹18,000 loss per lot. Never carry naked futures. Buy protective puts (Hedge) to cap downside.
*   **Monitor Jan 2026 Rollovers**: Be aware that Nifty lot size will reduce to **65** for contracts expiring in Jan 2026. Adjust your automated algos or quantity freeze limits accordingly.

## Conclusion

The shift to a 75-unit Nifty lot size and the ₹15 Lakh contract value rule marks a new era of maturity for Indian markets. While the capital requirement is higher, it filters out noise and pushes traders toward disciplined, capitalized strategies. The discontinuation of Bank Nifty weeklies simplifies the calendar but demands you adapt your expiry-day strategies. Whether you are hedging a portfolio or trading volatility, capital preservation is now more vital than ever.
