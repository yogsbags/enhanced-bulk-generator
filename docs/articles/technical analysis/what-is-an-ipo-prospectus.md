## Summary
This article examines the critical role of an IPO prospectus in the Indian primary market. We analyze the differences between a Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) and a Red Herring Prospectus (RHP), citing recent examples like Swiggy and NTPC Green Energy. The guide explains the regulatory framework under SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018, including the March 2025 amendments regarding promoter lock-ins and financial disclosures. Investors will learn how to decode risk factors, financial statements, and objects of the issue to make informed wealth-creation decisions.

In the world of primary markets, information is your only shield against volatility. Before a company like Swiggy or NTPC Green Energy hits the Dalal Street tickers, it must bare its soul in a document that often runs into 400+ pages. This document is the **Prospectus**. It is not just a brochure; it is a legally binding disclosure that defines exactly what you are buying, who is selling it, and—most importantly—what could go wrong. For Indian investors eyeing the IPO boom of FY 2025-26, understanding **What is an IPO Prospectus?** is the first step toward due diligence.

## Importance of an IPO Prospectus

Think of the prospectus as the \"birth certificate\" and \"medical report\" of a company going public combined into one. In the Indian context, where retail participation in IPOs has surged, the prospectus serves as the primary source of truth, superseding all marketing campaigns and news interviews.

It bridges the information asymmetry between the company's promoters (insiders) and you (the public investor). When you apply for an IPO, you are essentially buying a stake in a business based on the promises and data laid out in this document. If a company misleads investors here, they face severe legal consequences under the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI regulations.

For example, during the **Swiggy IPO** in November 2024, the Red Herring Prospectus (RHP) revealed critical details about its \"dark store\" network expansion plans and the specific breakdown of the ₹4,499 crore fresh issue versus the Offer for Sale (OFS). Without this document, investors would be flying blind, relying on hearsay rather than audited facts.

## Types of IPO Prospectuses

Not all prospectuses are the same. As an investor, you will encounter different versions at various stages of the IPO lifecycle. Here is how they differ:

### 1. Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP)
This is the first draft filed with SEBI. It contains almost all information except the specific price and quantity of shares. It is a \"proposal\" waiting for SEBI's observations.
*   **Purpose:** To invite public comments and regulatory review.
*   **Key Missing Info:** Price band and number of shares.
*   **Example:** Swiggy filed its DRHP months before its actual launch to get regulatory clearance.

### 2. Red Herring Prospectus (RHP)
This is the version you see just before the IPO opens. It incorporates SEBI's observations from the DRHP stage. It is called \"Red Herring\" because of a standard disclaimer stating that the information is not yet complete (specifically regarding price).
*   **Timing:** Filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) at least 3 days before the issue opens.
*   **Key Feature:** Contains the **Price Band** (or it is announced separately at least 2 working days before opening).
*   **Recent Context:** The **NTPC Green Energy IPO** RHP, filed on November 11, 2024, finalized the fresh issue size of ₹10,000 crore.

### 3. Shelf Prospectus
A single prospectus for multiple issues of securities over a certain period. This is typically used by banks and public financial institutions to raise funds repeatedly without filing a new document every time.
*   **Validity:** As per Section 31 of the Companies Act, 2013, a Shelf Prospectus is valid for **one year** from the date of the first offer.
*   **Requirement:** An \"Information Memorandum\" must be filed for subsequent issues to update material changes.

### 4. Abridged Prospectus
A summarized version of the full prospectus. SEBI mandates that every IPO application form must be accompanied by this abridged version. It condenses 400+ pages into salient features like risk factors, promoter details, and financials.

### 5. Deemed Prospectus
If a company agrees to allot securities to an intermediary (like a merchant bank) with the view that these will be offered to the public, the document inviting the public offer is deemed to be a prospectus. This prevents companies from bypassing prospectus rules by using a middleman.

## What Does an IPO Prospectus Contain?

Reading a 500-page document is daunting. Smart investors focus on these five critical sections:

### 1. Objects of the Issue
Where is your money going? This section clarifies if the funds are for:
*   **Fresh Issue:** Money goes into the company for growth (e.g., building factories, paying debt).
*   **Offer for Sale (OFS):** Money goes to existing shareholders (promoters/investors) who are exiting. The company gets **zero** funds from OFS.
*   **Example:** In the **Hyundai Motor India IPO** (October 2024), the entire issue was an OFS. The RHP clearly stated that the company would receive no proceeds from the offer.

### 2. Capital Structure
Details the pre-IPO and post-IPO shareholding pattern. It shows how much skin the promoters still have in the game. A significant reduction in promoter holding might signal a lack of confidence in future growth.

### 3. Risk Factors (Internal & External)
This is arguably the most important section. It lists specific risks that could derail the business.
*   **Internal:** \"We are dependent on 3 key clients for 60% of revenue.\"
*   **External:** \"Changes in government EV subsidies could impact our margins.\"
*   **Tip:** Look for *specific* risks, not generic ones like \"market volatility.\"

### 4. Financial Information
Audited financial statements for the last 3 years. Look for:
*   **Revenue Growth:** Is the top line increasing?
*   **Profit Margins:** Are they stable or shrinking?
*   **Debt Levels:** Is the company borrowing to survive or to grow?

### 5. Management & Litigations
Who runs the company? Are there criminal cases or tax disputes pending against the directors? The prospectus must disclose all outstanding litigations involving the company and its promoters.

## Regulation of IPO Prospectus

The content and filing of a prospectus are tightly regulated to protect your interest. The primary governing framework includes:

*   **Companies Act, 2013:** Defines the legal liability for misstatements (Section 34 & 35). Directors can face imprisonment for fraud if the prospectus contains false information.
*   **SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018:** The detailed rulebook for public issues. Key provisions include:
    *   **Regulation 25:** The validity of SEBI's observation letter is **12 months**. If the IPO doesn't open within this window, the company must refile.
    *   **Regulation 29(4):** The price band must be announced at least **2 working days** before the issue opens.

**Recent Update (March 2025):**
As per the **SEBI (ICDR) Amendment Regulations, 2025** (notified March 3, 2025), new norms have been introduced:
1.  **Promoter Lock-in:** If more than 50% of fresh issue proceeds are used for capital expenditure, the promoter lock-in is **3 years**. Otherwise, it remains 18 months.
2.  **Proforma Financials:** Companies can now voluntarily disclose proforma financial statements to reflect the impact of recent acquisitions, giving investors a clearer picture of the \"combined\" entity.

## Why Should You Read an IPO Prospectus?

Relying on grey market premium (GMP) or YouTube influencers is a recipe for disaster. Here is why the prospectus is your best friend:

*   **Fact vs. Fiction:** Marketing roadshows highlight the positives. The prospectus is legally required to highlight the negatives (Risk Factors).
*   **Valuation Sanity:** By checking the \"Basis for Issue Price\" section, you can compare the company's P/E ratio with listed industry peers. If a company asks for a P/E of 80x while peers trade at 40x, the prospectus helps you ask \"Why?\".
*   **Litigation Check:** You might discover that the company has a massive pending tax liability that could wipe out two years of profits. This info is often buried in the \"Legal\" section.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid While Reading IPO Prospectus

Even experienced investors slip up. Avoid these pitfalls:

1.  **Ignoring the \"Outstanding Litigations\" Section:** Don't just look at the number of cases. Look at the *quantum* of money involved. A ₹500 crore tax dispute for a company with ₹100 crore profit is a red flag.
2.  **Confusing Revenue with Profit:** A company might show 50% revenue growth but widening losses. Check the **Cash Flow from Operations**—is it positive?
3.  **Overlooking the \"Objects of the Issue\":** If a company is raising ₹1,000 crore primarily to \"repay debt\" or for \"general corporate purposes\" (GCP), it suggests a balance sheet repair job rather than growth funding.
4.  **Skipping the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A):** This section explains *why* the numbers moved. Did profits jump because of a one-time asset sale? The MD&A will tell you.

## Key Takeaways

*   **RHP vs. DRHP:** The DRHP is the draft; the RHP is the final version with SEBI observations, filed just before the IPO opens.
*   **Risk Factors First:** Always start reading from the \"Risk Factors\" section. It reveals the true vulnerabilities of the business.
*   **OFS vs. Fresh Issue:** Check if the money is going to the company (Fresh Issue) or exiting shareholders (OFS).
*   **Validity:** A Shelf Prospectus is valid for 1 year; SEBI's observation letter for an IPO is valid for 12 months.
*   **Regulatory Shield:** SEBI's 2025 amendments ensure stricter disclosures on how promoters use the money, enhancing your safety.

## Action Plan

**Month 1: Build Your Base**
*   Download the RHP of a recently listed company (e.g., NTPC Green Energy) from the NSE/BSE website.
*   Spend 30 minutes reading just the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Objects of the Issue\" sections.

**Month 2: Analyze a Live IPO**
*   When the next IPO is announced, access its RHP via your broker or exchange website.
*   Compare the \"Basis of Issue Price\" (P/E, EPS) with the industry peers listed in the document.

**Month 3: Execute with Discipline**
*   Before applying, verify the \"Promoter Holding\" pre- and post-issue.
*   If the promoter is selling a massive stake (OFS) and the company has weak cash flows, reconsider your application.

## Conclusion

An IPO prospectus is the ultimate truth serum for the primary market. While it may seem technical, it is the only document that legally binds the company to its claims. By mastering the art of reading a prospectus—distinguishing between a Fresh Issue and an Offer for Sale, and decoding the Risk Factors—you move from being a speculator to an informed investor. Don't let the page count scare you; the safety of your capital depends on the fine print.

## FAQs on IPO Prospectus

### What is a Prospectus in IPO?
A prospectus is a legal document filed by a company with SEBI and the Registrar of Companies (RoC) before an IPO. It discloses essential details like financial health, risk factors, promoters, and how the raised funds will be utilized, helping investors make informed decisions.

### Is it Better to Buy Pre or Post IPO?
Buying pre-IPO (unlisted shares) offers potential multi-bagger returns but carries high liquidity risk and lock-in periods. Buying post-IPO (listing day or later) offers liquidity and regulatory safety but often at a higher valuation. For most retail investors, the regulated IPO route via a prospectus is safer.

### What are the 4 Types of Prospectus?
The four main types are: **Red Herring Prospectus (RHP)** (incomplete details, used for book building), **Shelf Prospectus** (valid for multiple issues over 1 year), **Abridged Prospectus** (summary attached to application forms), and **Deemed Prospectus** (document for offer for sale via intermediaries).

### How Long is a Prospectus Valid?
A **Shelf Prospectus** is valid for **one year** from the date of the first offer (Section 31, Companies Act 2013). For a standard IPO, the **SEBI observation letter** is valid for **12 months**; if the issue doesn't open within this period, a fresh DRHP must be filed.

### What is the Difference Between DRHP and RHP?
The **DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus)** is the preliminary draft filed with SEBI for review and public comments. The **RHP (Red Herring Prospectus)** is the final version filed with the RoC before the issue opens, incorporating SEBI's observations and including the price band (or announcing it shortly after).
