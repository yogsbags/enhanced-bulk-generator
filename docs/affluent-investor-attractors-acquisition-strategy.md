# PL Capital: Affluent Investor Attractors & Acquisition Strategy

**Document Type**: Strategic Acquisition Blueprint
**Target**: Affluent Investors (₹15L-50L income, ₹50L-5Cr portfolio)
**Geography**: India (Urban + Emerging Cities)
**Created**: January 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines **irresistible attractors** and **acquisition channels** specifically designed for India's affluent investor segment (30-45 years, ₹15L-50L income). Unlike mass-market discount broker strategies, these attractors focus on **exclusivity, community, knowledge, and networking** - the true motivators for high-value clients.

**Key Insight**: Affluent investors don't switch brokers for ₹20 brokerage savings. They switch for:
1. **Exclusive Access** - Premium research, expert insights, early opportunities
2. **Peer Community** - Networking with similar wealth profiles
3. **Knowledge Leverage** - Learn from experts without dedicating full-time effort
4. **Status Signaling** - Association with premium brand and successful investors
5. **Convenience** - Concierge-style service that saves time

## Conclusion

**The Affluent Investor Acquisition Playbook** is fundamentally different from mass-market discount broker strategies:

### Key Differences

| Dimension | Discount Brokers | PL Capital (Full-Service) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Attractors** | Low brokerage fees | Exclusive research, community, advisory |
| **Channels** | Performance marketing (Google/FB ads) | Content + corporate partnerships + referrals |
| **Conversion Rate** | 0.5-1% | 5-10% |
| **CAC** | ₹1,000-2,000 | ₹15,000 |
| **ARPU** | ₹1,000/year | ₹15,000/year |
| **LTV/CAC** | 0.5-1:1 | 5:1 |
| **Moat** | None (price war) | Community + advisory relationship |

### Why This Strategy Works

1. **Network Effects**: Community = more valuable as it grows (WhatsApp groups, events, referrals)
2. **Defensible Moat**: Discount brokers can't copy (not their business model), full-service brokers won't copy (lack content/community DNA)
3. **High Margins**: 1.5% advisory fee on ₹50L AUM = ₹7,500/year vs ₹500 brokerage
4. **Sticky Clients**: Advisory relationship + community = multi-year retention
5. **Scalable**: Content, tools, events serve thousands with minimal incremental cost

### Next Steps

1. **Approve this strategy**: Review attractors and acquisition channels
2. **Budget allocation**: ₹50L for Year 1 (content, paid media, events, team)
3. **Team hiring**: 3 RMs, 1 CFP, 1 content marketer, 1 community manager
4. **90-day sprint**: Execute Month 1-3 roadmap
5. **Measure & iterate**: Track metrics, optimize based on data
