## EXAMPLES OF STRONG OPENINGS

### Example 1 (MTF article):
> "Imagine this scenario – you have discovered your dream home. It comes with a hefty price tag of INR 1 crore, while you currently have only INR 50 lakh in your account. So, what do you do? You go to a bank, secure a home loan for the remaining amount, and successfully purchase the house.
>
> This, essentially, is the premise of Margin Trading Facility or MTF."

**Why it works:**
- Relatable analogy (home buying)
- Specific numbers (INR 1 crore)
- Sets up the "problem-solution" framework
- Connects analogy to topic in second paragraph

### Example 2 (Book-building article):
> "Book-building is a term commonly used in initial public offerings (IPOs). When a company is going to launch an IPO, you might have heard about this term along with 'price band', 'lot size', 'cut-off price' and many more.
>
> A book-building plays a pivotal role in determining the final price of shares sold to investors.
>
> Read this blog to understand book-building meaning, how it works, and its advantages and disadvantages."

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges reader's prior exposure
- Positions topic in context (IPO ecosystem)
- States the importance upfront
- Explicit preview of what's covered
