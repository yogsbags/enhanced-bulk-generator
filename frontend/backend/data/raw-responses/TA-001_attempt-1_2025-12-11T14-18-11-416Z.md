We analyze the shift to a 12.5% Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) rate, the new ₹1.25 lakh exemption limit, and the critical changes to share buyback taxation effective October 2024. The guide explains how these rules impact your portfolio returns and provides actionable strategies for tax harvesting and loss set-off to optimize your wealth creation journey.\n\nThe financial landscape for Indian equity investors has undergone a structural shift following the Union Budget 2024 and subsequent amendments. With the new tax regime fully operational for FY 2025-26, understanding the nuances of capital gains, buyback taxation, and transaction costs is no longer optional—it is a survival skill for your portfolio. Whether you are a long-term compounder or an active trader, the rules of engagement have changed.\n\n## The New Equity Tax Regime: FY 2025-26 Explained\n\nFor years, Indian investors enjoyed a relatively stable tax environment. However, the amendments effective from July 23, 2024, have reset the baseline. As of December 2025, here is the definitive tax structure for listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds.\n\n### Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)\n\nIf you hold equity shares or equity mutual funds for more than **12 months**, your gains are classified as Long-Term Capital Gains. The tax treatment for FY 2025-26 is as follows:\n\n*   **Tax Rate:** **12.5%** (increased from the previous 10%).\n*   **Exemption Limit:** **₹1.25 Lakh** per financial year (increased from ₹1 Lakh).\n*   **Indexation:** **No indexation benefit** is available for equity assets.\n*   **Grandfathering:** The grandfathering clause remains intact. Gains accrued up to **January 31, 2018**, are protected. Your cost of acquisition for shares bought before this date is the higher of the actual cost or the closing price on January 31, 2018 (subject to the sale price cap).\n\n**Example Calculation:**\nImagine you bought shares of Reliance Industries for ₹5 Lakh in April 2024 and sold them for ₹7 Lakh in December 2025 (holding > 12 months).\n\n| Component | Amount (₹) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Sale Value | 7,00,000 |\n| Purchase Cost | 5,00,000 |\n| **Total Capital Gain** | **2,00,000** |\n| Less: Exemption | 1,25,000 |\n| **Taxable Gain** | **75,000** |\n| **Tax Payable (12.5%)** | **9,375** |\n\n*Note: Cess and surcharge apply as per your income slab.*\n\n### Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG)\n\nIf you sell equity assets within **12 months** of purchase, the gains are Short-Term Capital Gains. The rate saw a sharp hike in July 2024.\n\n*   **Tax Rate:** **20%** flat (increased from 15%).\n*   **Exemption:** No basic exemption limit applies specifically to STCG (though resident individuals can adjust the basic exemption limit shortfall against STCG if their other income is nil).\n\n**Impact:** For active traders or swing investors, the cost of churn has increased by 33% (from 15% to 20%). A ₹1 Lakh short-term profit now attracts ₹20,000 tax instead of ₹15,000.\n\n## The Buyback Tax Trap: A \"Deemed Dividend\" Shock\n\nPerhaps the most disruptive change for FY 2025-26 involves share buybacks. Historically, companies paid a buyback tax (approx. 23.3%), and shareholders received the entire amount tax-free. This arbitrage ended on **October 1, 2024**.\n\n### How It Works Now\nAs per the Finance Act 2024, buyback proceeds are now taxed in the hands of the shareholder as **\"Deemed Dividend\"**.\n\n1.  **Taxable Income:** The **entire** buyback amount (Sale Price × Quantity) is added to your income and taxed at your applicable slab rate.\n2.  **Capital Loss:** Since you have surrendered your shares, the cost at which you bought them is treated as a **Capital Loss**.\n\n### The Double Whammy\nHere is the catch: You cannot set off the capital loss against the dividend income. The dividend income is taxed under \"Income from Other Sources,\" while the loss is under \"Capital Gains.\"\n\n**Scenario:**\nYou are in the 30% tax bracket. You bought 100 shares of TCS at ₹3,500 (Cost = ₹3.5 Lakh). The company buys them back at ₹4,500 (Value = ₹4.5 Lakh).\n\n*   **Taxable Dividend:** ₹4.5 Lakh is added to your income. Tax @ 30% (+ Cess) ≈ **₹1.4 Lakh**.\n*   **Capital Loss Generated:** Your cost of ₹3.5 Lakh becomes a capital loss.\n*   **The Problem:** You pay ₹1.4 Lakh tax immediately. You now have a ₹3.5 Lakh capital loss carried forward. Unless you have other capital gains (e.g., from selling other stocks) to set this loss off against, you face a cash flow hit.\n\n> \"The new buyback rules effectively shift the tax burden from the corporate balance sheet to the individual investor's pocket. High-net-worth individuals in the 39% or 42.7% surcharge brackets are hit hardest.\"\n> — Senior Tax Strategist, PL Capital\n\n## Transaction Costs: The Silent Portfolio Eroder\n\nWhile direct taxes grab headlines, transaction costs quietly eat into your alpha. As of December 2025, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) rates are higher for derivative traders.\n\n### Current STT Rates (FY 2025-26)\n\n| Segment | Transaction Type | Rate | Impact |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Equity Delivery** | Buy & Sell | 0.1% | No change. ₹100 per ₹1 Lakh turnover. |\n| **Equity Intraday** | Sell Only | 0.025% | No change. ₹25 per ₹1 Lakh turnover. |\n| **Futures** | Sell Only | **0.02%** | Hiked from 0.0125% (Oct 2024). |\n| **Options** | Sell Premium | **0.1%** | Hiked from 0.0625% (Oct 2024). |\n\n**Actionable Insight:** If you trade F&O, your breakeven points have shifted higher. Ensure your trading journal accounts for this 60% jump in Options STT.\n\n## Strategic Tax Harvesting: Using the ₹1.25 Lakh Limit\n\nWith the exemption limit raised to ₹1.25 Lakh, \"Tax Gain Harvesting\" is a powerful strategy to reduce your future tax liability. This involves selling winning stocks to book gains up to ₹1.25 Lakh and immediately buying them back.\n\n### How It Works\n1.  **Identify Gains:** Check your portfolio for stocks held >12 months with unrealized gains.\n2.  **Sell & Buy:** Sell enough shares to realize ₹1.20 Lakh profit (keeping a buffer below ₹1.25 Lakh).\n3.  **Result:** You pay **zero tax** on this gain. Your \"Cost of Acquisition\" for the repurchased shares resets to the current market price.\n4.  **Future Benefit:** When you sell these shares years later, your taxable gain will be lower because your buy price is higher.\n\n**Example:**\n*   Bought Stock A at ₹100. Current Price ₹150. Gain = ₹50.\n*   Sell at ₹150. Realize ₹50 gain (Tax-free if total LTCG < ₹1.25 Lakh).\n*   Buy back at ₹150.\n*   New Cost Basis = ₹150. If price goes to ₹200, future taxable gain is only ₹50 (200-150), not ₹100 (200-100).\n\n## Understanding Loss Set-Off Rules\n\nEffective tax planning requires knowing which losses can cancel out which gains. As per the Income Tax Act 1961 (current for FY 2025-26):\n\n| Loss Type | Can Set Off Against | Cannot Set Off Against |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Short-Term Capital Loss (STCL)** | Both STCG and LTCG | Salary, Business Income, Dividends |\n| **Long-Term Capital Loss (LTCL)** | **Only LTCG** | STCG, Salary, Business Income |\n\n**Important Note:** While there are discussions about future codes (like the proposed Income Tax Bill 2025) allowing broader set-offs, for your FY 2025-26 filing, you must strictly adhere to the rule that **LTCL cannot set off STCG**.\n\n### The Buyback Strategy\nIf you participated in a buyback and generated a significant capital loss (LTCL or STCL depending on holding period), review your portfolio. You might want to book profits in other stocks to utilize this loss, rather than carrying it forward for 8 years.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n*   **LTCG is 12.5%:** The rate is higher, but so is the exemption (₹1.25 Lakh). Plan your exits accordingly.\n*   **STCG is 20%:** Short-term trading is costlier. Ensure your risk-reward ratio justifies the higher tax.\n*   **Buybacks are Taxable:** Treat buybacks as dividends. Be prepared for tax at your slab rate and a capital loss carry-forward.\n*   **Harvest Gains:** Use the ₹1.25 Lakh annual limit religiously. It is a \"use it or lose it\" benefit.\n*   **Harvest Losses:** If you have STCG liability, booking STCL from loss-making positions can save you flat 20% tax.\n*   **Watch Transaction Costs:** Higher STT on F&O means scalping strategies need tighter spreads to be profitable.\n\n## Action Plan\n\n**Month 1-2: Portfolio Audit**\n*   Download your \"Unrealized Gain/Loss\" statement.\n*   Identify stocks held >12 months with gains.\n*   Identify stocks with deep losses that are unlikely to recover.\n\n**Month 3-9: Strategic Execution**\n*   Execute \"Tax Gain Harvesting\" to utilize the ₹1.25 Lakh exemption.\n*   If you participated in any buyback after Oct 1, 2024, calculate the \"Deemed Dividend\" tax liability and set aside funds.\n\n**Month 10-12 (Jan-Mar 2026): Final Review**\n*   Check total realized STCG and LTCG for the year.\n*   Book losses (if necessary) to offset high gains before March 31.\n*   Ensure you do not sell and buy back the *same* stock for loss booking on the same day (wash sale rules are grey but best avoided; wait 24 hours).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe tax implications of long-term equity investments in 2026 demand a proactive approach. The era of 10% tax and tax-free buybacks is behind us. By understanding the new 12.5% regime and the buyback dividend rules, you can prevent tax leakage from eroding your compounding. The goal isn't just to earn returns, but to keep them.\n\nReady to optimize your portfolio for the new tax era?

This applies to gains exceeding the annual exemption limit of **₹1.25 Lakh**. No indexation benefit is available.\n\n### How is share buyback taxed for shareholders in 2026?\nEffective October 1, 2024, the entire buyback amount is taxed as **\"Deemed Dividend\"** at your applicable income tax slab rate. The cost of acquisition of the tendered shares is treated as a **Capital Loss**, which can be set off against other capital gains or carried forward for 8 years.\n\n### Can I set off Long-Term Capital Loss against Short-Term Capital Gains?\nNo. Under current income tax rules for FY 2025-26, Long-Term Capital Loss (LTCL) can **only** be set off against Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG). It cannot be used to reduce Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG). However, Short-Term Capital Loss (STCL) can be set off against both STCG and LTCG.\n\n### Has the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) increased?\nYes, specifically for the derivatives segment. Effective October 1, 2024, the STT on the sale of **Futures** increased to **0.02%** and on the sale of **Options** (premium) increased to **0.1%**. STT on equity delivery trades remains unchanged at 0.1%.\n\n### What is the grandfathering clause for equity LTCG?\nThe grandfathering clause protects gains earned up to **January 31, 2018**. If you sell shares bought before this date, your cost of acquisition is calculated as the higher of: (a) Actual Cost, or (b) Lower of [Sale Price vs. Closing Price on Jan 31, 2018]. This ensures gains up to that date remain tax-free.",
