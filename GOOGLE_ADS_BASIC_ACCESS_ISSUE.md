## üöÄ Solution: Apply for Standard Access

### Step 1: Visit API Center
Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter

### Step 2: Apply for Standard Access
1. Click **"Request Standard Access"** or **"Upgrade Access Level"**
2. Fill out the application form:
   - **Company/Product Name**: Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd
   - **Company Website**: https://www.plindia.com/
   - **Tool Type**: **"Reporting Only"** ‚≠ê (Important for faster approval!)
   - **API Use Case**:
     ```
     "SEO keyword research and reporting tool for financial content optimization.
     This is a REPORTING ONLY tool that reads keyword metrics via the Keyword
     Planner API. No campaign creation, modification, or management functionality.
     Complies with RMF Reporting-only requirements."
     ```
   - **Expected API Usage**: "Keyword research reporting for 100-1000 keywords/day"
   - **RMF Compliance**: "Tool complies with Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) Reporting-only requirements. See: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/api-policy/rmf"
   - **Contact Email**: prabhudaslilladherindia@gmail.com

3. Submit and wait for approval (typically 2-3 business days, potentially faster for Reporting-only tools)

### Step 3: After Approval
Once approved, test immediately:
```bash
node research/google-ads-api-client.js "mutual funds" "SIP investment"
```

## ‚è∞ Alternative: Temporary Solutions (Until Approval)

While waiting for Standard Access approval, use these alternatives:

### Option 1: Use Google Ads MCP Server (via Cursor/Claude Code)
The MCP integration may bypass token restrictions when used through Cursor.

**Test:**
```bash
node test-google-ads-mcp.js
```

**Note**: MCP tools can only be called within Cursor IDE, not standalone scripts.

### Option 2: Use DataForSEO API (Paid Backup)
Already configured in your system. Cost: ‚Çπ0.04/keyword.

**Enable in workflow:**
```javascript
const fetcher = new SEODataFetcher({
  useDataForSEO: true,
  dataForSEOLogin: 'your-login',
  dataForSEOPassword: 'your-password'
});
```

### Option 3: Use AI Estimates (Free Fallback)
The system already falls back to AI-estimated metrics when APIs are unavailable.

**Current behavior:**
- Search Volume: Estimated based on keyword patterns
- Competition: Generic estimates
- Confidence: "low" (indicates estimated data)

## üìù Recommended Immediate Actions

### Priority 1: Apply for Standard Access (Do Now)
1. Visit https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter
2. Click "Request Standard Access"
3. Submit application with details above
4. **Timeline**: 2-3 business days for approval

### Priority 2: Continue Development (Meanwhile)
Your workflow will continue using:
1. AI estimates (free, lower accuracy)

3. Google MCP (free, via Cursor) - limited to IDE usage

### Priority 3: Test After Approval
Once Standard Access is approved:
```bash
# Test keyword research
node research/google-ads-api-client.js "mutual funds"

# Run full workflow
node main.js stage research
```
