## 🔧 Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

You need to configure environment variables for the app to work properly. Choose one method:

#### Option A: Via CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/yogs87/Downloads/sanity/projects/enhanced-bulk-generator

# Run the interactive setup script
./setup-netlify-env.sh

# OR set them manually:
npx netlify env:set GROQ_API_KEY "your-groq-api-key"
npx netlify env:set OPENAI_API_KEY "your-openai-key"
npx netlify env:set UAT_WP_BASE_URL "https://uat.plindia.com"
npx netlify env:set UAT_WP_USERNAME "pl_capital_admin"
npx netlify env:set UAT_WP_APPLICATION_PASSWORD "your-password"
npx netlify env:set SANITY_PROJECT_ID "1eg1vt8d"
npx netlify env:set SANITY_DATASET "production"
npx netlify env:set SANITY_TOKEN "your-token"
npx netlify env:set IMGBB_API_KEY "your-imgbb-key"
```

#### Option B: Via Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/content-creator-pl/settings/deploys#environment-variables
2. Click "Add a variable" for each environment variable
3. Refer to `ENV_SETUP.md` for the complete list

### Step 2: Trigger a New Deployment

After setting environment variables:

```bash
# Option 1: Trigger via git push (recommended)
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add deployment documentation"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Trigger manual deployment
npx netlify deploy --prod

# Option 3: Trigger via Netlify dashboard
# Visit: https://app.netlify.com/projects/content-creator-pl/deploys
# Click "Trigger deploy" > "Deploy site"
```

### Step 3: Test the Deployment

Once deployed:

1. **Visit the site**: https://content-creator-pl.netlify.app
2. **Check the dashboard** displays correctly
3. **Test workflow execution** (requires environment variables to be set):
   - Select a category (e.g., "Derivatives")
   - Set topic limit
   - Click "Execute Full Workflow"
   - Monitor real-time logs

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- Check build status: https://app.netlify.com/projects/content-creator-pl/deploys
- Look for build errors in the logs
- Ensure netlify.toml is correctly configured

### Workflow Not Executing
- ⚠️ Environment variables must be set in Netlify
- Check that GROQ_API_KEY is configured
- Verify WordPress and Sanity credentials
- Review function logs in Netlify dashboard

### Build Failures
Common issues:
1. **Missing dependencies**: Check package.json in frontend/
2. **Node version mismatch**: Netlify uses Node 20 (configured in netlify.toml)
3. **Path issues**: Ensure base directory is set to `frontend/`

## 📝 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check Netlify status
npx netlify status

# List environment variables
npx netlify env:list

# View recent deployments
npx netlify open:admin

# Trigger manual deployment
npx netlify deploy --prod

# View site in browser
npx netlify open:site

# View function logs
npx netlify functions:log

# Link to different site (if needed)
npx netlify link
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Site Name
```bash
npx netlify sites:update content-creator-pl --name your-new-name
```

### Custom Domain
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/content-creator-pl/settings/domain
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

### Environment-Specific Variables
Set different values for production vs preview:

```bash
# Production only
npx netlify env:set KEY "value" --context production

# Deploy previews only
npx netlify env:set KEY "value" --context deploy-preview
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ API keys removed from committed files
- ✅ Environment variables stored securely in Netlify
- ✅ .gitignore configured to prevent credential leaks
- ✅ Security headers configured in netlify.toml
